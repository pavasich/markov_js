         do something fun with chains

    This iteration of Markov waits patiently until passed a string with
      Markov.readText(string)
    The generated Markov chains are left un-normalized, thus allowing
      further calls of readText
    Call Markov.finalize() to normalize the chains and generate output,
      accessed via Markov.out
    Note that this iteration refuses to parse text after being finalized.

He is very near by this he was not three leagues off when I left him LEONATO How many gentlemen have you lost in this action Messenger But few of any sort, and none of name LEONATO A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers I find here that Don Peter hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio Messenger Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb, the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how LEONATO He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it Messenger I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness LEONATO Did he break out into tears Messenger In great measure LEONATO A kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping BEATRICE I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no Messenger I know none of that name, lady there was none such in the army of any sort LEONATO What is he that you ask for, niece HERO My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua Messenger O, he's returned and as pleasant as ever he was BEATRICE He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight and my uncle's fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars But how many hath he killed for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing LEONATO Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not Messenger He hath done good service, lady, in these wars BEATRICE You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach Messenger And a good soldier too, lady BEATRICE And a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord Messenger A lord to a lord, a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues BEATRICE It is so, indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal LEONATO You must not, sir, mistake my niece There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them BEATRICE Alas he gets nothing by that In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left, to be known a reasonable creature Who is his companion now He hath every month a new sworn brother Messenger Is't possible BEATRICE Very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block Messenger I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books BEATRICE No an he were, I would burn my study But, I pray you, who is his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil Messenger He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio BEATRICE O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad God help the noble Claudio if he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a' be cured Messenger I will hold friends with you, lady BEATRICE Do, good friend LEONATO You will never run mad, niece BEATRICE No, not till a hot January Messenger Don Pedro is approached Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR  DON PEDRO Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it LEONATO Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone, comfort should remain but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave DON PEDRO You embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your daughter LEONATO Her mother hath many times told me so BENEDICK Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her LEONATO Signior Benedick, no for then were you a child DON PEDRO You have it full, Benedick we may guess by this what you are, being a man Truly, the lady fathers herself Be happy, lady for you are like an honourable father BENEDICK If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is BEATRICE I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick nobody marks you BENEDICK What, my dear Lady Disdain are you yet living BEATRICE Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence BENEDICK Then is courtesy a turncoat But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart for, truly, I love none BEATRICE A dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me BENEDICK God keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate scratched face BEATRICE Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such a face as yours were BENEDICK Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher BEATRICE A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours BENEDICK I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer But keep your way, i' God's name I have done BEATRICE You always end with a jade's trick I know you of old DON PEDRO That is the sum of all, Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart LEONATO If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn To DON JOHN  Let me bid you welcome, my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother, I owe you all duty DON JOHN I thank you I am not of many words, but I thank you LEONATO Please it your grace lead on DON PEDRO Your hand, Leonato we will go together Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO  CLAUDIO Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato BENEDICK I noted her not but I looked on her CLAUDIO Is she not a modest young lady BENEDICK Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex CLAUDIO No I pray thee speak in sober judgment BENEDICK Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is, I do not like her CLAUDIO Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her BENEDICK Would you buy her, that you inquire after her CLAUDIO Can the world buy such a jewel BENEDICK Yea, and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song CLAUDIO In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on BENEDICK I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter there's her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you CLAUDIO I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife BENEDICK Is't come to this In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again Go to, i' faith an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you Re-enter DON PEDRO  DON PEDRO What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato's BENEDICK I would your grace would constrain me to tell DON PEDRO I charge thee on thy allegiance BENEDICK You hear, Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I would have you think so but, on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance He is in love With who now that is your grace's part Mark how short his answer is--With Hero, Leonato's short daughter CLAUDIO If this were so, so were it uttered BENEDICK Like the old tale, my lord 'it is not so, nor 'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be so' CLAUDIO If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise DON PEDRO Amen, if you love her for the lady is very well worthy CLAUDIO You speak this to fetch me in, my lord DON PEDRO By my troth, I speak my thought CLAUDIO And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine BENEDICK And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine CLAUDIO That I love her, I feel DON PEDRO That she is worthy, I know BENEDICK That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me I will die in it at the stake DON PEDRO Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty CLAUDIO And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will BENEDICK That a woman conceived me, I thank her that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is, for the which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor DON PEDRO I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love BENEDICK With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid DON PEDRO Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument BENEDICK If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder, and called Adam DON PEDRO Well, as time shall try 'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke' BENEDICK The savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write 'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign 'Here you may see Benedick the married man' CLAUDIO If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad DON PEDRO Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly BENEDICK I look for an earthquake too, then DON PEDRO Well, you temporize with the hours In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato's commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation BENEDICK I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so I commit you-- CLAUDIO To the tuition of God From my house, if I had it,-- DON PEDRO The sixth of July Your loving friend, Benedick BENEDICK Nay, mock not, mock not The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience and so I leave you Exit  CLAUDIO My liege, your highness now may do me good DON PEDRO My love is thine to teach teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good CLAUDIO Hath Leonato any son, my lord DON PEDRO No child but Hero she's his only heir Dost thou affect her, Claudio CLAUDIO O, my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye, That liked, but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars DON PEDRO Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her and with her father, And thou shalt have her Was't not to this end That thou began'st to twist so fine a story CLAUDIO How sweetly you do minister to love, That know love's grief by his complexion But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise DON PEDRO What need the bridge much broader than the flood The fairest grant is the necessity Look, what will serve is fit 'tis once, thou lovest, And I will fit thee with the remedy I know we shall have revelling to-night I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio, And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale Then after to her father will I break And the conclusion is, she shall be thine In practise let us put it presently Exeunt  SCENE II A room in LEONATO's house  Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting LEONATO How now, brother Where is my cousin, your son hath he provided this music ANTONIO He is very busy about it But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of LEONATO Are they good ANTONIO As the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward The prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it LEONATO Hath the fellow any wit that told you this ANTONIO A good sharp fellow I will send for him and question him yourself LEONATO No, no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true Go you and tell her of it Enter Attendants  Cousins, you know what you have to do O, I cry you mercy, friend go you with me, and I will use your skill Good cousin, have a care this busy time Exeunt  SCENE III The same  Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE CONRADE What the good-year, my lord why are you thus out of measure sad DON JOHN There is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit CONRADE You should hear reason DON JOHN And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it CONRADE If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance DON JOHN I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art, born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when I have cause and smile at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour CONRADE Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest DON JOHN I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage If I had my mouth, I would bite if I had my liberty, I would do my liking in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me CONRADE Can you make no use of your discontent DON JOHN I make all use of it, for I use it only Who comes here Enter BORACHIO  What news, Borachio BORACHIO I came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage DON JOHN Will it serve for any model to build mischief on What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness BORACHIO Marry, it is your brother's right hand DON JOHN Who the most exquisite Claudio BORACHIO Even he DON JOHN A proper squire And who, and who which way looks he BORACHIO Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato DON JOHN A very forward March-chick How came you to this BORACHIO Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio DON JOHN Come, come, let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way You are both sure, and will assist me CONRADE To the death, my lord DON JOHN Let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that I am subdued Would the cook were of my mind Shall we go prove what's to be done BORACHIO We'll wait upon your lordship Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I A hall in LEONATO'S house  Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others LEONATO Was not Count John here at supper ANTONIO I saw him not BEATRICE How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after HERO He is of a very melancholy disposition BEATRICE He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling LEONATO Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior Benedick's face,-- BEATRICE With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if a' could get her good-will LEONATO By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue ANTONIO In faith, she's too curst BEATRICE Too curst is more than curst I shall lessen God's sending that way for it is said, 'God sends a curst cow short horns' but to a cow too curst he sends none LEONATO So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns BEATRICE Just, if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in the woollen LEONATO You may light on a husband that hath no beard BEATRICE What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him therefore, I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell LEONATO Well, then, go you into hell BEATRICE No, but to the gate and there will the devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven here's no place for you maids' so deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long ANTONIO To HERO Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father BEATRICE Yes, faith it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy and say 'Father, as it please you' But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please me' LEONATO Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband BEATRICE Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl No, uncle, I'll none Adam's sons are my brethren and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred LEONATO Daughter, remember what I told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer BEATRICE The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer For, hear me, Hero wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave LEONATO Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly BEATRICE I have a good eye, uncle I can see a church by daylight LEONATO The revellers are entering, brother make good room All put on their masks  Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked  DON PEDRO Lady, will you walk about with your friend HERO So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away DON PEDRO With me in your company HERO I may say so, when I please DON PEDRO And when please you to say so HERO When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be like the case DON PEDRO My visor is Philemon's roof within the house is Jove HERO Why, then, your visor should be thatched DON PEDRO Speak low, if you speak love Drawing her aside  BALTHASAR Well, I would you did like me MARGARET So would not I, for your own sake for I have many ill-qualities BALTHASAR Which is one MARGARET I say my prayers aloud BALTHASAR I love you the better the hearers may cry, Amen MARGARET God match me with a good dancer BALTHASAR Amen MARGARET And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done Answer, clerk BALTHASAR No more words the clerk is answered URSULA I know you well enough you are Signior Antonio ANTONIO At a word, I am not URSULA I know you by the waggling of your head ANTONIO To tell you true, I counterfeit him URSULA You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man Here's his dry hand up and down you are he, you are he ANTONIO At a word, I am not URSULA Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself Go to, mum, you are he graces will appear, and there's an end BEATRICE Will you not tell me who told you so BENEDICK No, you shall pardon me BEATRICE Nor will you not tell me who you are BENEDICK Not now BEATRICE That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales'--well this was Signior Benedick that said so BENEDICK What's he BEATRICE I am sure you know him well enough BENEDICK Not I, believe me BEATRICE Did he never make you laugh BENEDICK I pray you, what is he BEATRICE Why, he is the prince's jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet I would he had boarded me BENEDICK When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say BEATRICE Do, do he'll but break a comparison or two on me which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy and then there's a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night Music  We must follow the leaders BENEDICK In every good thing BEATRICE Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning Dance Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO  DON JOHN Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but one visor remains BORACHIO And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing DON JOHN Are not you Signior Benedick CLAUDIO You know me well I am he DON JOHN Signior, you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on Hero I pray you, dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it CLAUDIO How know you he loves her DON JOHN I heard him swear his affection BORACHIO So did I too and he swore he would marry her to-night DON JOHN Come, let us to the banquet Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO  CLAUDIO Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio 'Tis certain so the prince wooes for himself Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not Farewell, therefore, Hero Re-enter BENEDICK  BENEDICK Count Claudio CLAUDIO Yea, the same BENEDICK Come, will you go with me CLAUDIO Whither BENEDICK Even to the next willow, about your own business, county What fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck, like an usurer's chain or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero CLAUDIO I wish him joy of her BENEDICK Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks But did you think the prince would have served you thus CLAUDIO I pray you, leave me BENEDICK Ho now you strike like the blind man 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post CLAUDIO If it will not be, I'll leave you Exit  BENEDICK Alas, poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me The prince's fool Ha It may be I go under that title because I am merry Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so reputed it is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well, I'll be revenged as I may Re-enter DON PEDRO  DON PEDRO Now, signior, where's the count did you see him BENEDICK Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him, and I think I told him true, that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and I offered him my company to a willow-tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped DON PEDRO To be whipped What's his fault BENEDICK The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it DON PEDRO Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is in the stealer BENEDICK Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest DON PEDRO I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner BENEDICK If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly DON PEDRO The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you BENEDICK O, she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards, and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her she would infect to the north star I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too Come, talk not of her you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would conjure her for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her DON PEDRO Look, here she comes Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO  BENEDICK Will your grace command me any service to the world's end I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy You have no employment for me DON PEDRO None, but to desire your good company BENEDICK O God, sir, here's a dish I love not I cannot endure my Lady Tongue Exit  DON PEDRO Come, lady, come you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick BEATRICE Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your grace may well say I have lost it DON PEDRO You have put him down, lady, you have put him down BEATRICE So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek DON PEDRO Why, how now, count wherefore are you sad CLAUDIO Not sad, my lord DON PEDRO How then sick CLAUDIO Neither, my lord BEATRICE The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion DON PEDRO I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won I have broke with her father, and his good will obtained name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy LEONATO Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match, and an grace say Amen to it BEATRICE Speak, count, 'tis your cue CLAUDIO Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little happy, if I could say how much Lady, as you are mine, I am yours I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange BEATRICE Speak, cousin or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither DON PEDRO In faith, lady, you have a merry heart BEATRICE Yea, my lord I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart CLAUDIO And so she doth, cousin BEATRICE Good Lord, for alliance Thus goes every one to the world but I, and I am sunburnt I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband DON PEDRO Lady Beatrice, I will get you one BEATRICE I would rather have one of your father's getting Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them DON PEDRO Will you have me, lady BEATRICE No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days your grace is too costly to wear every day But, I beseech your grace, pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter DON PEDRO Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour BEATRICE No, sure, my lord, my mother cried but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born Cousins, God give you joy LEONATO Niece, will you look to those things I told you of BEATRICE I cry you mercy, uncle By your grace's pardon Exit  DON PEDRO By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady LEONATO There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing DON PEDRO She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband LEONATO O, by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit DON PEDRO She were an excellent wife for Benedict LEONATO O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad DON PEDRO County Claudio, when mean you to go to church CLAUDIO To-morrow, my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites LEONATO Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer my mind DON PEDRO Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other I would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction LEONATO My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings CLAUDIO And I, my lord DON PEDRO And you too, gentle Hero HERO I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband DON PEDRO And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer hi s glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift Exeunt  SCENE II The same  Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO DON JOHN It is so the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato BORACHIO Yea, my lord but I can cross it DON JOHN Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this marriage BORACHIO Not honestly, my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me DON JOHN Show me briefly how BORACHIO I think I told your lordship a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero DON JOHN I remember BORACHIO I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window DON JOHN What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage BORACHIO The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero DON JOHN What proof shall I make of that BORACHIO Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue DON JOHN Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing BORACHIO Go, then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered thus They will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown DON JOHN Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practise Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats BORACHIO Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me DON JOHN I will presently go learn their day of marriage Exeunt  SCENE III LEONATO'S orchard  Enter BENEDICK BENEDICK Boy Enter Boy  Boy Signior BENEDICK In my chamber-window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard Boy I am here already, sir BENEDICK I know that but I would have thee hence, and here again Exit Boy  I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster but I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair, yet I am well another is wise, yet I am well another virtuous, yet I am well but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be, that's certain wise, or I'll none virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her fair, or I'll never look on her mild, or come not near me noble, or not I for an angel of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God Ha the prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in the arbour Withdraws  Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO  DON PEDRO Come, shall we hear this music CLAUDIO Yea, my good lord How still the evening is, As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony DON PEDRO See you where Benedick hath hid himself CLAUDIO O, very well, my lord the music ended, We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth Enter BALTHASAR with Music  DON PEDRO Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again BALTHASAR O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once DON PEDRO It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more BALTHASAR Because you talk of wooing, I will sing Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes, Yet will he swear he loves DON PEDRO Now, pray thee, come Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes BALTHASAR Note this before my notes There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting DON PEDRO Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing Air  BENEDICK Now, divine air now is his soul ravished Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men's bodies Well, a horn for my money, when all's done The Song  BALTHASAR Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more, Men were deceivers ever, One foot in sea and one on shore, To one thing constant never Then sigh not so, but let them go, And be you blithe and bonny, Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny Sing no more ditties, sing no moe, Of dumps so dull and heavy The fraud of men was ever so, Since summer first was leafy Then sigh not so,  c DON PEDRO By my troth, a good song BALTHASAR And an ill singer, my lord DON PEDRO Ha, no, no, faith thou singest well enough for a shift BENEDICK An he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it DON PEDRO Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar I pray thee, get us some excellent music for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window BALTHASAR The best I can, my lord DON PEDRO Do so farewell Exit BALTHASAR  Come hither, Leonato What was it you told me of to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick CLAUDIO O, ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits I did never think that lady would have loved any man LEONATO No, nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor BENEDICK Is't possible Sits the wind in that corner LEONATO By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought DON PEDRO May be she doth but counterfeit CLAUDIO Faith, like enough LEONATO O God, counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it DON PEDRO Why, what effects of passion shows she CLAUDIO Bait the hook well this fish will bite LEONATO What effects, my lord She will sit you, you heard my daughter tell you how CLAUDIO She did, indeed DON PEDRO How, how, pray you You amaze me I would have I thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection LEONATO I would have sworn it had, my lord especially against Benedick BENEDICK I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence CLAUDIO He hath ta'en the infection hold it up DON PEDRO Hath she made her affection known to Benedick LEONATO No and swears she never will that's her torment CLAUDIO 'Tis true, indeed so your daughter says 'Shall I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him' LEONATO This says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she'll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all CLAUDIO Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of LEONATO O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet CLAUDIO That LEONATO O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her 'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit for I should flout him, if he writ to me yea, though I love him, I should' CLAUDIO Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses 'O sweet Benedick God give me patience' LEONATO She doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true DON PEDRO It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it CLAUDIO To what end He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse DON PEDRO An he should, it were an alms to hang him She's an excellent sweet lady and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous CLAUDIO And she is exceeding wise DON PEDRO In every thing but in loving Benedick LEONATO O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian DON PEDRO I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what a' will say LEONATO Were it good, think you CLAUDIO Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness DON PEDRO She doth well if she should make tender of her love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit CLAUDIO He is a very proper man DON PEDRO He hath indeed a good outward happiness CLAUDIO Before God and, in my mind, very wise DON PEDRO He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit CLAUDIO And I take him to be valiant DON PEDRO As Hector, I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear LEONATO If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling DON PEDRO And so will he do for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love CLAUDIO Never tell him, my lord let her wear it out with good counsel LEONATO Nay, that's impossible she may wear her heart out first DON PEDRO Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady LEONATO My lord, will you walk dinner is ready CLAUDIO If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation DON PEDRO Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage, and no such matter that's the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb-show Let us send her to call him in to dinner Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO  BENEDICK Coming forward This can be no trick the conference was sadly borne They have the truth of this from Hero They seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent Love me why, it must be requited I hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did never think to marry I must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair 'tis a truth, I can bear them witness and virtuous 'tis so, I cannot reprove it and wise, but for loving me by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No, the world must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day she's a fair lady I do spy some marks of love in her Enter BEATRICE  BEATRICE Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner BENEDICK Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains BEATRICE I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful, I would not have come BENEDICK You take pleasure then in the message BEATRICE Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point and choke a daw withal You have no stomach, signior fare you well Exit  BENEDICK Ha 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner' there's a double meaning in that 'I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me' that's as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain if I do not love her, I am a Jew I will go get her picture Exit  ACT III  SCENE I LEONATO'S garden  Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA HERO Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the prince and Claudio Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her say that thou overheard'st us And bid her steal into the pleached bower, Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun, Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites, Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it there will she hide her, To listen our purpose This is thy office Bear thee well in it and leave us alone MARGARET I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently Exit  HERO Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay Enter BEATRICE, behind  Now begin For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference URSULA The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream, And greedily devour the treacherous bait So angle we for Beatrice who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture Fear you not my part of the dialogue HERO Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it Approaching the bower  No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggerds of the rock URSULA But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely HERO So says the prince and my new-trothed lord URSULA And did they bid you tell her of it, madam HERO They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection, And never to let Beatrice know of it URSULA Why did you so Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon HERO O god of love I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man But Nature never framed a woman's heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprising what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak she cannot love, Nor take no shape nor project of affection, She is so self-endeared URSULA Sure, I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it HERO Why, you speak truth I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured, But she would spell him backward if fair-faced, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique, Made a foul blot if tall, a lance ill-headed If low, an agate very vilely cut If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds If silent, why, a block moved with none So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth URSULA Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable HERO No, not to be so odd and from all fashions As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable But who dare tell her so If I should speak, She would mock me into air O, she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling URSULA Yet tell her of it hear what she will say HERO No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with one doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking URSULA O, do not do your cousin such a wrong She cannot be so much without true judgment-- Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have--as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick HERO He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio URSULA I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valour, Goes foremost in report through Italy HERO Indeed, he hath an excellent good name URSULA His excellence did earn it, ere he had it When are you married, madam HERO Why, every day, to-morrow Come, go in I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow URSULA She's limed, I warrant you we have caught her, madam HERO If it proves so, then loving goes by haps Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps Exeunt HERO and URSULA  BEATRICE Coming forward What fire is in mine ears Can this be true Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much Contempt, farewell and maiden pride, adieu No glory lives behind the back of such And, Benedick, love on I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly Exit  SCENE II A room in LEONATO'S house  Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO DON PEDRO I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon CLAUDIO I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll vouchsafe me DON PEDRO Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks BENEDICK Gallants, I am not as I have been LEONATO So say Imethinks you are sadder CLAUDIO I hope he be in love DON PEDRO Hang him, truant there's no true drop of blood in him, to be truly touched with love if he be sad, he wants money BENEDICK I have the toothache DON PEDRO Draw it BENEDICK Hang it CLAUDIO You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards DON PEDRO What sigh for the toothache LEONATO Where is but a humour or a worm BENEDICK Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it CLAUDIO Yet say I, he is in love DON PEDRO There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as, to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as, a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is CLAUDIO If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs a' brushes his hat o' mornings what should that bode DON PEDRO Hath any man seen him at the barber's CLAUDIO No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis-balls LEONATO Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard DON PEDRO Nay, a' rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that CLAUDIO That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love DON PEDRO The greatest note of it is his melancholy CLAUDIO And when was he wont to wash his face DON PEDRO Yea, or to paint himself for the which, I hear what they say of him CLAUDIO Nay, but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute-string and now governed by stops DON PEDRO Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him conclude, conclude he is in love CLAUDIO Nay, but I know who loves him DON PEDRO That would I know too I warrant, one that knows him not CLAUDIO Yes, and his ill conditions and, in despite of all, dies for him DON PEDRO She shall be buried with her face upwards BENEDICK Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior, walk aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO  DON PEDRO For my life, to break with him about Beatrice CLAUDIO 'Tis even so Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet Enter DON JOHN  DON JOHN My lord and brother, God save you DON PEDRO Good den, brother DON JOHN If your leisure served, I would speak with you DON PEDRO In private DON JOHN If it please you yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him DON PEDRO What's the matter DON JOHN To CLAUDIO Means your lordship to be married to-morrow DON PEDRO You know he does DON JOHN I know not that, when he knows what I know CLAUDIO If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it DON JOHN You may think I love you not let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage--surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed DON PEDRO Why, what's the matter DON JOHN I came hither to tell you and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a talking of, the lady is disloyal CLAUDIO Who, Hero DON PEDRO Even she Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero CLAUDIO Disloyal DON JOHN The word is too good to paint out her wickedness I could say she were worse think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it Wonder not till further warrant go but with me to-night, you shall see her chamber-window entered, even the night before her wedding-day if you love her then, to-morrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind CLAUDIO May this be so DON PEDRO I will not think it DON JOHN If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know if you will follow me, I will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly CLAUDIO If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her DON PEDRO And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her DON JOHN I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself DON PEDRO O day untowardly turned CLAUDIO O mischief strangely thwarting DON JOHN O plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel Exeunt  SCENE III A street  Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch DOGBERRY Are you good men and true VERGES Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul DOGBERRY Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the prince's watch VERGES Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry DOGBERRY First, who think you the most desertless man to be constable First Watchman Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole for they can write and read DOGBERRY Come hither, neighbour Seacole God hath blessed you with a good name to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature Second Watchman Both which, master constable,-- DOGBERRY You have I knew it would be your answer Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern This is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name Second Watchman How if a' will not stand DOGBERRY Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave VERGES If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the prince's subjects DOGBERRY True, and they are to meddle with none but the prince's subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured Watchman We will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch DOGBERRY Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend only, have a care that your bills be not stolen Well, you are to call at all the ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed Watchman How if they will not DOGBERRY Why, then, let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for Watchman Well, sir DOGBERRY If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why the more is for your honesty Watchman If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him DOGBERRY Truly, by your office, you may but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company VERGES You have been always called a merciful man, partner DOGBERRY Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him VERGES If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it Watchman How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us DOGBERRY Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats VERGES 'Tis very true DOGBERRY This is the end of the charge--you, constable, are to present the prince's own person if you meet the prince in the night, you may stay him VERGES Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot DOGBERRY Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him marry, not without the prince be willing for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will VERGES By'r lady, I think it be so DOGBERRY Ha, ha, ha Well, masters, good night an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me keep your fellows' counsels and your own and good night Come, neighbour Watchman Well, masters, we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed DOGBERRY One word more, honest neighbours I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door for the wedding being there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night Adieu be vigitant, I beseech you Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES  Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE  BORACHIO What Conrade Watchman Aside Peace stir not BORACHIO Conrade, I say CONRADE Here, man I am at thy elbow BORACHIO Mass, and my elbow itched I thought there would a scab follow CONRADE I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale BORACHIO Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for it drizzles rain and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee Watchman Aside Some treason, masters yet stand close BORACHIO Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats CONRADE Is it possible that any villany should be so dear BORACHIO Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will CONRADE I wonder at it BORACHIO That shows thou art unconfirmed Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man CONRADE Yes, it is apparel BORACHIO I mean, the fashion CONRADE Yes, the fashion is the fashion BORACHIO Tush I may as well say the fool's the fool But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is Watchman Aside I know that Deformed a' has been a vile thief this seven year a' goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his name BORACHIO Didst thou not hear somebody CONRADE No 'twas the vane on the house BORACHIO Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily a' turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's priests in the old church-window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club CONRADE All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion BORACHIO Not so, neither but know that I have to-night wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the name of Hero she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night,--I tell this tale vilely--I should first tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter CONRADE And thought they Margaret was Hero BORACHIO Two of them did, the prince and Claudio but the devil my master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night and send her home again without a husband First Watchman We charge you, in the prince's name, stand Second Watchman Call up the right master constable We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth First Watchman And one Deformed is one of them I know him a' wears a lock CONRADE Masters, masters,-- Second Watchman You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you CONRADE Masters,-- First Watchman Never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us BORACHIO We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these men's bills CONRADE A commodity in question, I warrant you Come, we'll obey you Exeunt  SCENE IV HERO's apartment  Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA HERO Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise URSULA I will, lady HERO And bid her come hither URSULA Well Exit  MARGARET Troth, I think your other rabato were better HERO No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this MARGARET By my troth, 's not so good and I warrant your cousin will say so HERO My cousin's a fool, and thou art another I'll wear none but this MARGARET I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so HERO O, that exceeds, they say MARGARET By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of yours cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on 't HERO God give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy MARGARET 'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man HERO Fie upon thee art not ashamed MARGARET Of what, lady of speaking honourably Is not marriage honourable in a beggar Is not your lord honourable without marriage I think you would have me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband' and bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend nobody is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband' None, I think, and it be the right husband and the right wife otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy ask my Lady Beatrice else here she comes Enter BEATRICE  HERO Good morrow, coz BEATRICE Good morrow, sweet Hero HERO Why how now do you speak in the sick tune BEATRICE I am out of all other tune, methinks MARGARET Clap's into 'Light o' love' that goes without a burden do you sing it, and I'll dance it BEATRICE Ye light o' love, with your heels then, if your husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall lack no barns MARGARET O illegitimate construction I scorn that with my heels BEATRICE 'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin tis time you were ready By my troth, I am exceeding ill heigh-ho MARGARET For a hawk, a horse, or a husband BEATRICE For the letter that begins them all, H MARGARET Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more sailing by the star BEATRICE What means the fool, trow MARGARET Nothing I but God send every one their heart's desire HERO These gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume BEATRICE I am stuffed, cousin I cannot smell MARGARET A maid, and stuffed there's goodly catching of cold BEATRICE O, God help me God help me how long have you professed apprehension MARGARET Even since you left it Doth not my wit become me rarely BEATRICE It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your cap By my troth, I am sick MARGARET Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus, and lay it to your heart it is the only thing for a qualm HERO There thou prickest her with a thistle BEATRICE Benedictus why Benedictus you have some moral in this Benedictus MARGARET Moral no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning I meant, plain holy-thistle You may think perchance that I think you are in love nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man he swore he would never marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging and how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do BEATRICE What pace is this that thy tongue keeps MARGARET Not a false gallop Re-enter URSULA  URSULA Madam, withdraw the prince, the count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town, are come to fetch you to church HERO Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula Exeunt  SCENE V Another room in LEONATO'S house  Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES LEONATO What would you with me, honest neighbour DOGBERRY Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly LEONATO Brief, I pray you for you see it is a busy time with me DOGBERRY Marry, this it is, sir VERGES Yes, in truth it is, sir LEONATO What is it, my good friends DOGBERRY Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows VERGES Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I DOGBERRY Comparisons are odorous palabras, neighbour Verges LEONATO Neighbours, you are tedious DOGBERRY It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor duke's officers but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship LEONATO All thy tediousness on me, ah DOGBERRY Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it VERGES And so am I LEONATO I would fain know what you have to say VERGES Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina DOGBERRY A good old man, sir he will be talking as they say, when the age is in, the wit is out God help us it is a world to see Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges well, God's a good man an two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind An honest soul, i' faith, sir by my troth he is, as ever broke bread but God is to be worshipped all men are not alike alas, good neighbour LEONATO Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you DOGBERRY Gifts that God gives LEONATO I must leave you DOGBERRY One word, sir our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship LEONATO Take their examination yourself and bring it me I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you DOGBERRY It shall be suffigance LEONATO Drink some wine ere you go fare you well Enter a Messenger  Messenger My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband LEONATO I'll wait upon them I am ready Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger  DOGBERRY Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol we are now to examination these men VERGES And we must do it wisely DOGBERRY We will spare for no wit, I warrant you here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol Exeunt  ACT IV  SCENE I A church  Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants LEONATO Come, Friar Francis, be brief only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards FRIAR FRANCIS You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady CLAUDIO No LEONATO To be married to her friar, you come to marry her FRIAR FRANCIS Lady, you come hither to be married to this count HERO I do FRIAR FRANCIS If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls, to utter it CLAUDIO Know you any, Hero HERO None, my lord FRIAR FRANCIS Know you any, count LEONATO I dare make his answer, none CLAUDIO O, what men dare do what men may do what men daily do, not knowing what they do BENEDICK How now interjections Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he CLAUDIO Stand thee by, friar Father, by your leave Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter LEONATO As freely, son, as God did give her me CLAUDIO And what have I to give you back, whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift DON PEDRO Nothing, unless you render her again CLAUDIO Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness There, Leonato, take her back again Give not this rotten orange to your friend She's but the sign and semblance of her honour Behold how like a maid she blushes here O, what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid, By these exterior shows But she is none She knows the heat of a luxurious bed Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty LEONATO What do you mean, my lord CLAUDIO Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton LEONATO Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof, Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth, And made defeat of her virginity,-- CLAUDIO I know what you would say if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the 'forehand sin No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large But, as a brother to his sister, show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love HERO And seem'd I ever otherwise to you CLAUDIO Out on thee Seeming I will write against it You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals That rage in savage sensuality HERO Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide LEONATO Sweet prince, why speak not you DON PEDRO What should I speak I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale LEONATO Are these things spoken, or do I but dream DON JOHN Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true BENEDICK This looks not like a nuptial HERO True O God CLAUDIO Leonato, stand I here Is this the prince is this the prince's brother Is this face Hero's are our eyes our own LEONATO All this is so but what of this, my lord CLAUDIO Let me but move one question to your daughter And, by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly LEONATO I charge thee do so, as thou art my child HERO O, God defend me how am I beset What kind of catechising call you this CLAUDIO To make you answer truly to your name HERO Is it not Hero Who can blot that name With any just reproach CLAUDIO Marry, that can Hero Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue What man was he talk'd with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one Now, if you are a maid, answer to this HERO I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord DON PEDRO Why, then are you no maiden Leonato, I am sorry you must hear upon mine honour, Myself, my brother and this grieved count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confess'd the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret DON JOHN Fie, fie they are not to be named, my lord, Not to be spoke of There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment CLAUDIO O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been, If half thy outward graces had been placed About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart But fare thee well, most foul, most fair farewell, Thou pure impiety and impious purity For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious LEONATO Hath no man's dagger here a point for me HERO swoons  BEATRICE Why, how now, cousin wherefore sink you down DON JOHN Come, let us go These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO  BENEDICK How doth the lady BEATRICE Dead, I think Help, uncle Hero why, Hero Uncle Signior Benedick Friar LEONATO O Fate take not away thy heavy hand Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wish'd for BEATRICE How now, cousin Hero FRIAR FRANCIS Have comfort, lady LEONATO Dost thou look up FRIAR FRANCIS Yea, wherefore should she not LEONATO Wherefore Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood Do not live, Hero do not ope thine eyes For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life Grieved I, I had but one Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame O, one too much by thee Why had I one Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar's issue at my gates, Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy, I might have said 'No part of it is mine This shame derives itself from unknown loins' But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised And mine that I was proud on, mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again And salt too little which may season give To her foul-tainted flesh BENEDICK Sir, sir, be patient For my part, I am so attired in wonder, I know not what to say BEATRICE O, on my soul, my cousin is belied BENEDICK Lady, were you her bedfellow last night BEATRICE No, truly not although, until last night, I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow LEONATO Confirm'd, confirm'd O, that is stronger made Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie, Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness, Wash'd it with tears Hence from her let her die FRIAR FRANCIS Hear me a little For I have only been silent so long And given way unto this course of fortune  By noting of the lady I have mark'd A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire, To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth Call me a fool Trust not my reading nor my observations, Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenor of my book trust not my age, My reverence, calling, nor divinity, If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error LEONATO Friar, it cannot be Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury she not denies it Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness FRIAR FRANCIS Lady, what man is he you are accused of HERO They know that do accuse me I know none If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintain'd the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death FRIAR FRANCIS There is some strange misprision in the princes BENEDICK Two of them have the very bent of honour And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practise of it lives in John the bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies LEONATO I know not If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour, The proudest of them shall well hear of it Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine, Nor age so eat up my invention, Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly FRIAR FRANCIS Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case Your daughter here the princes left for dead Let her awhile be secretly kept in, And publish it that she is dead indeed Maintain a mourning ostentation And on your family's old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial LEONATO What shall become of this what will this do FRIAR FRANCIS Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse that is some good But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth She dying, as it must so be maintain'd, Upon the instant that she was accused, Shall be lamented, pitied and excused Of every hearer for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit, More moving-delicate and full of life, Into the eye and prospect of his soul, Than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver, And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood But if all aim but this be levell'd false, The supposition of the lady's death Will quench the wonder of her infamy And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation, In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries BENEDICK Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body LEONATO Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me FRIAR FRANCIS 'Tis well consented presently away For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure Come, lady, die to live this wedding-day Perhaps is but prolong'd have patience and endure Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE  BENEDICK Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while BEATRICE Yea, and I will weep a while longer BENEDICK I will not desire that BEATRICE You have no reason I do it freely BENEDICK Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged BEATRICE Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her BENEDICK Is there any way to show such friendship BEATRICE A very even way, but no such friend BENEDICK May a man do it BEATRICE It is a man's office, but not yours BENEDICK I do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange BEATRICE As strange as the thing I know not It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet I lie not I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing I am sorry for my cousin BENEDICK By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me BEATRICE Do not swear, and eat it BENEDICK I will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat it that says I love not you BEATRICE Will you not eat your word BENEDICK With no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love thee BEATRICE Why, then, God forgive me BENEDICK What offence, sweet Beatrice BEATRICE You have stayed me in a happy hour I was about to protest I loved you BENEDICK And do it with all thy heart BEATRICE I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest BENEDICK Come, bid me do any thing for thee BEATRICE Kill Claudio BENEDICK Ha not for the wide world BEATRICE You kill me to deny it Farewell BENEDICK Tarry, sweet Beatrice BEATRICE I am gone, though I am here there is no love in you nay, I pray you, let me go BENEDICK Beatrice,-- BEATRICE In faith, I will go BENEDICK We'll be friends first BEATRICE You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy BENEDICK Is Claudio thine enemy BEATRICE Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman O that I were a man What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour, --O God, that I were a man I would eat his heart in the market-place BENEDICK Hear me, Beatrice,-- BEATRICE Talk with a man out at a window A proper saying BENEDICK Nay, but, Beatrice,-- BEATRICE Sweet Hero She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone BENEDICK Beat-- BEATRICE Princes and counties Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect a sweet gallant, surely O that I were a man for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake But manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too he is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving BENEDICK Tarry, good Beatrice By this hand, I love thee BEATRICE Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it BENEDICK Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero BEATRICE Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul BENEDICK Enough, I am engaged I will challenge him I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account As you hear of me, so think of me Go, comfort your cousin I must say she is dead and so,

is thought you are false knaves BORACHIO Sir, I say to you we are none DOGBERRY Well, stand aside 'Fore God, they are both in a tale Have you writ down, that they are none Sexton Master constable, you go not the way to examine you must call forth the watch that are their accusers DOGBERRY Yea, marry, that's the eftest way Let the watch come forth Masters, I charge you, in the prince's name, accuse these men First Watchman This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's brother, was a villain DOGBERRY Write down Prince John a villain Why, this is flat perjury, to call a prince's brother villain

of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully DOGBERRY Flat burglary as ever was committed VERGES Yea, by mass, that it is Sexton What else, fellow First Watchman And that Count Claudio did mean,

Master constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato's I will go before and show him their examination Exit  DOGBERRY Come, let them be opinioned VERGES Let them be in the hands-- CONRADE Off, coxcomb DOGBERRY God's my life, where's the sexton let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb Come, bind them Thou naughty varlet CONRADE Away you are an ass, you are an ass DOGBERRY Dost thou not suspect my place dost thou not suspect my years O that he were here to write me down an ass But, masters, remember that I am an ass though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer, and, which is more, a householder, and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to and a rich fellow enough, go to and a fellow that hath had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every thing handsome about him Bring him away O that I had been writ down an ass Exeunt  ACT V  SCENE I Before LEONATO'S house  Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO ANTONIO If you go on thus, you will kill yourself And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself LEONATO I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve give not me counsel Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine, And bid him speak of patience Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form If such a one will smile and stroke his beard, Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem' when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience But there is no such man for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air and agony with words No, no 'tis all men's office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man's virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself Therefore give me no counsel My griefs cry louder than advertisement ANTONIO Therein do men from children nothing differ LEONATO I pray thee, peace I will be flesh and blood For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance ANTONIO Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself Make those that do offend you suffer too LEONATO There thou speak'st reason nay, I will do so My soul doth tell me Hero is belied And that shall Claudio know so shall the prince And all of them that thus dishonour her ANTONIO Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO  DON PEDRO Good den, good den CLAUDIO Good day to both of you LEONATO Hear you my lords,-- DON PEDRO We have some haste, Leonato LEONATO Some haste, my lord well, fare you well, my lord Are you so hasty now well, all is one DON PEDRO Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man ANTONIO If he could right himself with quarreling, Some of us would lie low CLAUDIO Who wrongs him LEONATO Marry, thou dost wrong me thou dissembler, thou-- Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword I fear thee not CLAUDIO Marry, beshrew my hand, If it should give your age such cause of fear In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword LEONATO Tush, tush, man never fleer and jest at me I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young, or what would do Were I not old Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, Do challenge thee to trial of a man I say thou hast belied mine innocent child Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors O, in a tomb where never scandal slept, Save this of hers, framed by thy villany CLAUDIO My villany LEONATO Thine, Claudio thine, I say DON PEDRO You say not right, old man LEONATO My lord, my lord, I'll prove it on his body, if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practise, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood CLAUDIO Away I will not have to do with you LEONATO Canst thou so daff me Thou hast kill'd my child If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man ANTONIO He shall kill two of us, and men indeed But that's no matter let him kill one first Win me and wear me let him answer me Come, follow me, boy come, sir boy, come, follow me Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will LEONATO Brother,-- ANTONIO Content yourself God knows I loved my niece And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains, That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops LEONATO Brother Antony,-- ANTONIO Hold you content What, man I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,-- Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go anticly, show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dangerous words, How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst And this is all LEONATO But, brother Antony,-- ANTONIO Come, 'tis no matter Do not you meddle let me deal in this DON PEDRO Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience My heart is sorry for your daughter's death But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof LEONATO My lord, my lord,-- DON PEDRO I will not hear you LEONATO No Come, brother away I will be heard ANTONIO And shall, or some of us will smart for it Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO  DON PEDRO See, see here comes the man we went to seek Enter BENEDICK  CLAUDIO Now, signior, what news BENEDICK Good day, my lord DON PEDRO Welcome, signior you are almost come to part almost a fray CLAUDIO We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth DON PEDRO Leonato and his brother What thinkest thou Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them BENEDICK In a false quarrel there is no true valour I came to seek you both CLAUDIO We have been up and down to seek thee for we are high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away Wilt thou use thy wit BENEDICK It is in my scabbard shall I draw it DON PEDRO Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side CLAUDIO Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels draw, to pleasure us DON PEDRO As I am an honest man, he looks pale Art thou sick, or angry CLAUDIO What, courage, man What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care BENEDICK Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it against me I pray you choose another subject CLAUDIO Nay, then, give him another staff this last was broke cross DON PEDRO By this light, he changes more and more I think he be angry indeed CLAUDIO If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle BENEDICK Shall I speak a word in your ear CLAUDIO God bless me from a challenge BENEDICK Aside to CLAUDIO You are a villain I jest not I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me hear from you CLAUDIO Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer DON PEDRO What, a feast, a feast CLAUDIO I' faith, I thank him he hath bid me to a calf's head and a capon the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife's naught Shall I not find a woodcock too BENEDICK Sir, your wit ambles well it goes easily DON PEDRO I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day I said, thou hadst a fine wit 'True,' said she, 'a fine little one' 'No,' said I, 'a great wit' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one' 'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit' 'Just,' said she, 'it hurts nobody' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman is wise' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman' 'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues' 'That I believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning there's a double tongue there's two tongues' Thus did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular virtues yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy CLAUDIO For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not DON PEDRO Yea, that she did but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly the old man's daughter told us all CLAUDIO All, all and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden DON PEDRO But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on the sensible Benedick's head CLAUDIO Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the married man' BENEDICK Fare you well, boy you know my mind I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked, hurt not My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you I must discontinue your company your brother the bastard is fled from Messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady For my Lord Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet and, till then, peace be with him Exit  DON PEDRO He is in earnest CLAUDIO In most profound earnest and, I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice DON PEDRO And hath challenged thee CLAUDIO Most sincerely DON PEDRO What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit CLAUDIO He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man DON PEDRO But, soft you, let me be pluck up, my heart, and be sad Did he not say, my brother was fled Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO  DOGBERRY Come you, sir if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to DON PEDRO How now two of my brother's men bound Borachio one CLAUDIO Hearken after their offence, my lord DON PEDRO Officers, what offence have these men done DOGBERRY Marry, sir, they have committed false report moreover, they have spoken untruths secondarily, they are slanders sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady thirdly, they have verified unjust things and, to conclude, they are lying knaves DON PEDRO First, I ask thee what they have done thirdly, I ask thee what's their offence sixth and lastly, why they are committed and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge CLAUDIO Rightly reasoned, and in his own division and, by my troth, there's one meaning well suited DON PEDRO Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer this learned constable is too cunning to be understood what's your offence BORACHIO Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me, and let this count kill me I have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments, how you disgraced her, when you should marry her my villany they have upon record which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain DON PEDRO Runs not this speech like iron through your blood CLAUDIO I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it DON PEDRO But did my brother set thee on to this BORACHIO Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it DON PEDRO He is composed and framed of treachery And fled he is upon this villany CLAUDIO Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first DOGBERRY Come, bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass VERGES Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the Sexton too Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton  LEONATO Which is the villain let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him which of these is he BORACHIO If you would know your wronger, look on me LEONATO Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd Mine innocent child BORACHIO Yea, even I alone LEONATO No, not so, villain thou beliest thyself Here stand a pair of honourable men A third is fled, that had a hand in it I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death Record it with your high and worthy deeds 'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it CLAUDIO I know not how to pray your patience Yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin yet sinn'd I not But in mistaking DON PEDRO By my soul, nor I And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That he'll enjoin me to LEONATO I cannot bid you bid my daughter live That were impossible but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died and if your love Can labour ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night To-morrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that's dead, And she alone is heir to both of us Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge CLAUDIO O noble sir, Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me I do embrace your offer and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio LEONATO To-morrow then I will expect your coming To-night I take my leave This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong, Hired to it by your brother BORACHIO No, by my soul, she was not, Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me, But always hath been just and virtuous In any thing that I do know by her DOGBERRY Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed they say be wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's name, the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing for God's sake pray you, examine him upon that point LEONATO I thank thee for thy care and honest pains DOGBERRY Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth and I praise God for you LEONATO There's for thy pains DOGBERRY God save the foundation LEONATO Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee DOGBERRY I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the example of others God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it Come, neighbour Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES  LEONATO

Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice MARGARET Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty BENEDICK In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it MARGARET To have no man come over me why, shall I always keep below stairs BENEDICK Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth it catches MARGARET And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit, but hurt not BENEDICK A most manly wit, Margaret it will not hurt a woman and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice I give thee the bucklers MARGARET Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own BENEDICK If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids MARGARET Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs BENEDICK And therefore will come Exit MARGARET  Sings  The god of love, That sits above, And knows me, and knows me, How pitiful I deserve,-- I mean in singing but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme I have tried I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent rhyme for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme for, 'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms Enter BEATRICE  Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee BEATRICE Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me BENEDICK O, stay but till then BEATRICE 'Then' is spoken fare you well now and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio BENEDICK Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee BEATRICE Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome therefore I will depart unkissed BENEDICK Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward And, I pray thee now, tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me BEATRICE For them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me BENEDICK Suffer love a good epithet I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will BEATRICE In spite of your heart, I think alas, poor heart If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours for I will never love that which my friend hates BENEDICK Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably BEATRICE It appears not in this confession there's not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself BENEDICK An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the lime of good neighbours If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps BEATRICE And how long is that, think you BENEDICK Question why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy and now tell me, how doth your cousin BEATRICE Very ill BENEDICK And how do you BEATRICE Very ill too BENEDICK Serve God, love me and mend There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste Enter URSULA  URSULA Madam, you must come to your uncle Yonder's old coil at home it is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily abused and Don John is the author of all, who is fed and gone Will you come presently BEATRICE Will you go hear this news, signior BENEDICK I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's Exeunt  SCENE III A church  Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers CLAUDIO Is this the monument of Leonato Lord It is, my lord CLAUDIO Reading out of a scroll Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn SONG Pardon, goddess of the night, Those that slew thy virgin knight For the which, with songs of woe, Round about her tomb they go Midnight, assist our moan Help us to sigh and groan, Heavily, heavily Graves, yawn and yield your dead, Till death be uttered, Heavily, heavily CLAUDIO Now, unto thy bones good night Yearly will I do this rite DON PEDRO Good morrow, masters put your torches out The wolves have prey'd and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey Thanks to you all, and leave us fare you well CLAUDIO Good morrow, masters each his several way DON PEDRO Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds And then to Leonato's we will go

FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO FRIAR FRANCIS Did I not tell you she was innocent LEONATO So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated But Margaret was in some fault for this, Although against her will, as it appears In the true course of all the question ANTONIO Well, I am glad that all things sort so well BENEDICK And so am I, being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it LEONATO Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither mask'd Exeunt Ladies  The prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me You know your office, brother You must be father to your brother's daughter And give her to young Claudio ANTONIO Which I will do with confirm'd countenance BENEDICK Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think FRIAR FRANCIS To do what, signior BENEDICK To bind me, or undo me one of them Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favour LEONATO That eye my daughter lent her 'tis most true BENEDICK And I do with an eye of love requite her LEONATO The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the prince but what's your will BENEDICK Your answer, sir, is enigmatical But, for my will, my will is your good will May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd In the state of honourable marriage In which, good friar, I shall desire your help LEONATO My heart is with your liking FRIAR FRANCIS And my help Here comes the prince and Claudio Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others  DON PEDRO Good morrow to this fair assembly LEONATO Good morrow, prince good morrow, Claudio We here attend you Are you yet determined To-day to marry with my brother's daughter CLAUDIO I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope LEONATO Call her forth, brother here's the friar ready Exit ANTONIO  DON PEDRO Good morrow, Benedick Why, what's the matter, That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness CLAUDIO I think he thinks upon the savage bull Tush, fear not, man we'll tip thy horns with gold And all Europa shall rejoice at thee, As once Europa did at lusty Jove, When he would play the noble beast in love BENEDICK Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow, And got a calf in that same noble feat Much like to you, for you have just his bleat CLAUDIO For this I owe you here comes other reckonings Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked  Which is the lady I must seize upon ANTONIO This same is she, and I do give you her CLAUDIO Why, then she's mine Sweet, let me see your face LEONATO No, that you shall not, till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her CLAUDIO Give me your hand before this holy friar, I am your husband, if you like of me HERO And when I lived, I was your other wife Unmasking  And when you loved, you were my other husband CLAUDIO Another Hero HERO Nothing certainer One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid DON PEDRO The former Hero Hero that is dead LEONATO She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived FRIAR FRANCIS All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended, I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death Meantime let wonder seem familiar, And to the chapel let us presently BENEDICK Soft and fair, friar Which is Beatrice BEATRICE Unmasking I answer to that name What is your will BENEDICK Do not you love me BEATRICE Why, no no more than reason BENEDICK Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio Have been deceived they swore you did BEATRICE Do not you love me BENEDICK Troth, no no more than reason BEATRICE Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceived for they did swear you did BENEDICK They swore that you were almost sick for me BEATRICE They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me BENEDICK 'Tis no such matter Then you do not love me BEATRICE No, truly, but in friendly recompense LEONATO Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman CLAUDIO And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion'd to Beatrice HERO And here's another Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick BENEDICK A miracle here's our own hands against our hearts Come, I will have thee but, by this light, I take thee for pity BEATRICE I would not deny you but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption BENEDICK Peace I will stop your mouth Kissing her  DON PEDRO How dost thou, Benedick, the married man BENEDICK I'll tell thee what, prince a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram No if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear nothing handsome about him In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin CLAUDIO I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee BENEDICK Come, come, we are friends let's have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels LEONATO We'll have dancing afterward BENEDICK First, of my word therefore play, music Prince, thou art

dullest scent Trust me, I take him for the better dog Lord Thou art a fool if Echo were as fleet, I would esteem him worth a dozen such But sup them well and look unto them all To-morrow I intend to hunt again First Huntsman I will, my lord Lord What's here one dead, or drunk See, doth he breathe Second Huntsman He breathes, my lord Were he not warm'd with ale, This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly Lord O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man What think you, if he were convey'd to bed, Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, A most delicious banquet by his bed, And brave attendants near him when he wakes, Would not the beggar then forget himself First Huntsman Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose Second Huntsman It would seem strange unto him when he waked Lord Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy Then take him up and manage well the jest Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet Procure me music ready when he wakes, To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound And if he chance to speak, be ready straight And with a low submissive reverence Say 'What is it your honour will command' Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers, Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands' Some one be ready with a costly suit And ask him what apparel he will wear Another tell him of his hounds and horse, And that his lady mourns at his disease Persuade him that he hath been lunatic And when he says he is, say that he dreams, For he is nothing but a mighty lord This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs It will be pastime passing excellent, If it be husbanded with modesty First Huntsman My lord, I warrant you we will play our part, As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is Lord Take him up gently and to bed with him And each one to his office when he wakes Some bear out SLY A trumpet sounds  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds Exit Servingman  Belike, some noble gentleman that means, Travelling some journey, to repose him here Re-enter Servingman  How now who is it Servant An't please your honour, players That offer service to your lordship Lord Bid them come near Enter Players  Now, fellows, you are welcome Players We thank your honour Lord Do you intend to stay with me tonight A Player So please your lordship to accept our duty Lord With all my heart This fellow I remember, Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son 'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well I have forgot your name but, sure, that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd A Player I think 'twas Soto that your honour means Lord 'Tis very true thou didst it excellent Well, you are come to me in a happy time The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much There is a lord will hear you play to-night But I am doubtful of your modesties Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,-- For yet his honour never heard a play-- You break into some merry passion And so offend him for I tell you, sirs, If you should smile he grows impatient A Player Fear not, my lord we can contain ourselves, Were he the veriest antic in the world Lord Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, And give them friendly welcome every one Let them want nothing that my house affords Exit one with the Players  Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page, And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance Tell him from me, as he will win my love, He bear himself with honourable action, Such as he hath observed in noble ladies Unto their lords, by them accomplished Such duty to the drunkard let him do With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, And say 'What is't your honour will command, Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love' And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, And with declining head into his bosom, Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd To see her noble lord restored to health, Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar And if the boy have not a woman's gift To rain a shower of commanded tears, An onion will do well for such a shift, Which in a napkin being close convey'd Shall in despite enforce a watery eye See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst Anon I'll give thee more instructions Exit a Servingman  I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman I long to hear him call the drunkard husband, And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant I'll in to counsel them haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen Which otherwise would grow into extremes Exeunt  SCENE II A bedchamber in the Lord's house  Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances and Lord SLY For God's sake, a pot of small ale First Servant Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack Second Servant Will't please your honour taste of these conserves Third Servant What raiment will your honour wear to-day SLY I am Christophero Sly call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship' I ne'er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet nay, sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather Lord Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour O, that a mighty man of such descent, Of such possessions and so high esteem, Should be infused with so foul a spirit SLY What, would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom What I am not bestraught here's-- Third Servant O, this it is that makes your lady mourn Second Servant O, this is it that makes your servants droop Lord Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, As beaten hence by your strange lunacy O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck Wilt thou have music hark Apollo plays, Music  And twenty caged nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep we'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground Or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trapp'd, Their harness studded all with gold and pearl Dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth First Servant Say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe Second Servant Dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook, And Cytherea all in sedges hid, Which seem to move and wanton with her breath, Even as the waving sedges play with wind Lord We'll show thee Io as she was a maid, And how she was beguiled and surprised, As lively painted as the deed was done Third Servant Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds, And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep, So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn Lord Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age First Servant And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face, She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to none SLY Am I a lord and have I such a lady Or do I dream or have I dream'd till now I do not sleep I see, I hear, I speak I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things Upon my life, I am a lord indeed And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly Well, bring our lady hither to our sight And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale Second Servant Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands O, how we joy to see your wit restored O, that once more you knew but what you are These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept SLY These fifteen years by my fay, a goodly nap But did I never speak of all that time First Servant O, yes, my lord, but very idle words For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door And rail upon the hostess of the house And say you would present her at the leet, Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket SLY Ay, the woman's maid of the house Third Servant Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up, As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever saw SLY Now Lord be thanked for my good amends ALL Amen SLY I thank thee thou shalt not lose by it Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants  Page How fares my noble lord SLY Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough Where is my wife Page Here, noble lord what is thy will with her SLY Are you my wife and will not call me husband My men should call me 'lord' I am your goodman Page My husband and my lord, my lord and husband I am your wife in all obedience SLY I know it well What must I call her Lord Madam SLY Al'ce madam, or Joan madam Lord 'Madam,' and nothing else so lords call ladies SLY Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more Page Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandon'd from your bed SLY 'Tis much Servants, leave me and her alone Madam, undress you and come now to bed Page Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two, Or, if not so, until the sun be set For your physicians have expressly charged, In peril to incur your former malady, That I should yet absent me from your bed I hope this reason stands for my excuse SLY Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood Enter a Messenger  Messenger Your honour's players, heating your amendment, Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet, Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life SLY Marry, I will, let them play it Is not a comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick Page No, my good lord it is more pleasing stuff SLY What, household stuff Page It is a kind of history SLY Well, well see't Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world slip we shall ne'er be younger Flourish  ACT I  SCENE I Padua A public place  Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO LUCENTIO Tranio, since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, The pleasant garden of great Italy And by my father's love and leave am arm'd With his good will and thy good company, My trusty servant, well approved in all, Here let us breathe and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies Pisa renown'd for grave citizens Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincetino come of Bentivolii Vincetino's son brought up in Florence It shall become to serve all hopes conceived, To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achieved Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come, as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst TRANIO Mi perdonato, gentle master mine, I am in all affected as yourself Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy Only, good master, while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline, Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured Balk logic with acquaintance that you have And practise rhetoric in your common talk Music and poesy use to quicken you The mathematics and the metaphysics, Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en In brief, sir, study what you most affect LUCENTIO Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore, We could at once put us in readiness, And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget But stay a while what company is this TRANIO Master, some show to welcome us to town Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by  BAPTISTA Gentlemen, importune me no farther, For how I firmly am resolved you know That is, not bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder If either of you both love Katharina, Because I know you well and love you well, Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure GREMIO Aside To cart her rather she's too rough for me There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife KATHARINA I pray you, sir, is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates HORTENSIO Mates, maid how mean you that no mates for you, Unless you were of gentler, milder mould KATHARINA I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear I wis it is not half way to her heart But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool And paint your face and use you like a fool HORTENSIA From all such devils, good Lord deliver us GREMIO And me too, good Lord TRANIO Hush, master here's some good pastime toward That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward LUCENTIO But in the other's silence do I see Maid's mild behavior and sobriety Peace, Tranio TRANIO Well said, master mum and gaze your fill BAPTISTA Gentlemen, that I may soon make good What I have said, Bianca, get you in And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl KATHARINA A pretty peat it is best Put finger in the eye, an she knew why BIANCA Sister, content you in my discontent Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to took and practise by myself LUCENTIO Hark, Tranio thou may'st hear Minerva speak HORTENSIO Signior Baptista, will you be so strange Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca's grief GREMIO Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, And make her bear the penance of her tongue BAPTISTA Gentlemen, content ye I am resolved Go in, Bianca Exit BIANCA  And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth If you, Hortensio, Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such, Prefer them hither for to cunning men I will be very kind, and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up And so farewell Katharina, you may stay For I have more to commune with Bianca Exit  KATHARINA Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha Exit  GREMIO You may go to the devil's dam your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on both sides Farewell yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father HORTENSIO So will I, Signior Gremio but a word, I pray Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to labour and effect one thing specially GREMIO What's that, I pray HORTENSIO Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister GREMIO A husband a devil HORTENSIO I say, a husband GREMIO I say, a devil Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell HORTENSIO Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough GREMIO I cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition, to be whipped at the high cross every morning HORTENSIO Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten apples But come since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to't a fresh Sweet Bianca Happy man be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring How say you, Signior Gremio GREMIO I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the house of her Come on Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO  TRANIO I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold LUCENTIO O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely But see, while idly I stood looking on, I found the effect of love in idleness And now in plainness do confess to thee, That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the queen of Carthage was, Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio, If I achieve not this young modest girl Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt TRANIO Master, it is no time to chide you now Affection is not rated from the heart If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so, 'Redime te captum quam queas minimo' LUCENTIO Gramercies, lad, go forward this contents The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound TRANIO Master, you look'd so longly on the maid, Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all LUCENTIO O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand TRANIO Saw you no more mark'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din LUCENTIO Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her TRANIO Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance I pray, awake, sir if you love the maid, Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her Thus it stands Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd That till the father rid his hands of her, Master, your love must live a maid at home And therefore has he closely mew'd her up, Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors LUCENTIO Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he But art thou not advised, he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her TRANIO Ay, marry, am I, sir and now 'tis plotted LUCENTIO I have it, Tranio TRANIO Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one LUCENTIO Tell me thine first TRANIO You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid That's your device LUCENTIO It is may it be done TRANIO Not possible for who shall bear your part, And be in Padua here Vincentio's son, Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, Visit his countrymen and banquet them LUCENTIO Basta content thee, for I have it full We have not yet been seen in any house, Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces For man or master then it follows thus Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, Keep house and port and servants as I should I will some other be, some Florentine, Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa 'Tis hatch'd and shall be so Tranio, at once Uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak When Biondello comes, he waits on thee But I will charm him first to keep his tongue TRANIO So had you need In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, And I am tied to be obedient For so your father charged me at our parting, 'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he, Although I think 'twas in another sense I am content to be Lucentio, Because so well I love Lucentio LUCENTIO Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye Here comes the rogue Enter BIONDELLO  Sirrah, where have you been BIONDELLO Where have I been Nay, how now where are you Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes Or you stolen his or both pray, what's the news LUCENTIO Sirrah, come hither 'tis no time to jest, And therefore frame your manners to the time Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life, Puts my apparel and my countenance on, And I for my escape have put on his For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill'd a man and fear I was descried Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, While I make way from hence to save my life You understand me BIONDELLO I, sir ne'er a whit LUCENTIO And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth Tranio is changed into Lucentio BIONDELLO The better for him would I were so too TRANIO So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio But in all places else your master Lucentio LUCENTIO Tranio, let's go one thing more rests, that thyself execute, to make one among these wooers if thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty Exeunt  The presenters above speak  First Servant My lord, you nod you do not mind the play SLY Yes, by Saint Anne, do I A good matter, surely comes there any more of it Page My lord, 'tis but begun SLY 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady would 'twere done They sit and mark  SCENE II Padua Before HORTENSIO'S house  Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO PETRUCHIO Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best beloved and approved friend, Hortensio and I trow this is his house Here, sirrah Grumio knock, I say GRUMIO Knock, sir whom should I knock is there man has rebused your worship PETRUCHIO Villain, I say, knock me here soundly GRUMIO Knock you here, sir why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir PETRUCHIO Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate GRUMIO My master is grown quarrelsome I should knock you first, And then I know after who comes by the worst PETRUCHIO Will it not be Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it He wrings him by the ears  GRUMIO Help, masters, help my master is mad PETRUCHIO Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain Enter HORTENSIO  HORTENSIO How now what's the matter My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona PETRUCHIO Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray 'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say HORTENSIO 'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio Petruchio' Rise, Grumio, rise we will compound this quarrel GRUMIO Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see, two and thirty, a pip out Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst PETRUCHIO A senseless villain Good Hortensio, I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it GRUMIO Knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly' And come you now with, 'knocking at the gate' PETRUCHIO Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you HORTENSIO Petruchio, patience I am Grumio's pledge Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona PETRUCHIO Such wind as scatters young men through the world, To seek their fortunes farther than at home Where small experience grows But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me Antonio, my father, is deceased And I have thrust myself into this maze, Haply to wive and thrive as best I may Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world HORTENSIO Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich And very rich but thou'rt too much my friend, And I'll not wish thee to her PETRUCHIO Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we Few words suffice and therefore, if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife, As wealth is burden of my wooing dance, Be she as foul as was Florentius' love, As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse, She moves me not, or not removes, at least, Affection's edge in me, were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas I come to wive it wealthily in Padua If wealthily, then happily in Padua GRUMIO Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal HORTENSIO Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in, I will continue that I broach'd in jest I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough and young and beauteous, Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman Her only fault, and that is faults enough, Is that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold PETRUCHIO Hortensio, peace thou know'st not gold's effect Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough For I will board her, though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack HORTENSIO Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman Her name is Katharina Minola, Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue PETRUCHIO I know her father, though I know not her And he knew my deceased father well I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither GRUMIO I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why, that's nothing an he begin once, he'll rail in his rope-tricks I'll tell you what sir, an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat You know him not, sir HORTENSIO Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista's keep my treasure is He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love, Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehearsed, That ever Katharina will be woo'd Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katharina the curst have got a husband GRUMIO Katharina the curst A title for a maid of all titles the worst HORTENSIO Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca That so I may, by this device, at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her And unsuspected court her by herself GRUMIO Here's no knavery See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised  Master, master, look about you who goes there, ha HORTENSIO Peace, Grumio it is the rival of my love Petruchio, stand by a while GRUMIO A proper stripling and an amorous GREMIO O, very well I have perused the note Hark you, sir I'll have them very fairly bound All books of love, see that at any hand And see you read no other lectures to her You understand me over and beside Signior Baptista's liberality, I'll mend it with a largess Take your paper too, And let me have them very well perfumed For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to What will you read to her LUCENTIO Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you As for my patron, stand you so assured, As firmly as yourself were still in place Yea, and perhaps with more successful words Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir GREMIO O this learning, what a thing it is GRUMIO O this woodcock, what an ass it is PETRUCHIO Peace, sirrah HORTENSIO Grumio, mum God save you, Signior Gremio GREMIO And you are well met, Signior Hortensio Trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola I promised to inquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man, for learning and behavior Fit for her turn, well read in poetry And other books, good ones, I warrant ye HORTENSIO 'Tis well and I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca, so beloved of me GREMIO Beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove GRUMIO And that his bags shall prove HORTENSIO Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love Listen to me, and if you speak me fair, I'll tell you news indifferent good for either Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met, Upon agreement from us to his liking, Will undertake to woo curst Katharina, Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please GREMIO So said, so done, is well Hortensio, have you told him all her faults PETRUCHIO I know she is an irksome brawling scold If that be all, masters, I hear no harm GREMIO No, say'st me so, friend What countryman PETRUCHIO Born in Verona, old Antonio's son My father dead, my fortune lives for me And I do hope good days and long to see GREMIO O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name You shall have me assisting you in all But will you woo this wild-cat PETRUCHIO Will I live GRUMIO Will he woo her ay, or I'll hang her PETRUCHIO Why came I hither but to that intent Think you a little din can daunt mine ears Have I not in my time heard lions roar Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang And do you tell me of a woman's tongue, That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire Tush, tush fear boys with bugs GRUMIO For he fears none GREMIO Hortensio, hark This gentleman is happily arrived, My mind presumes, for his own good and ours HORTENSIO I promised we would be contributors And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er GREMIO And so

the streets as free For me as for you GREMIO But so is not she TRANIO For what reason, I beseech you GREMIO For this reason, if you'll know, That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio HORTENSIO That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio TRANIO Softly, my masters if you be gentlemen, Do me this right hear me with patience Baptista is a noble gentleman, To whom my father is not all unknown And were his daughter fairer than she is, She may more suitors have and me for one Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have And so she shall Lucentio shall make one, Though Paris came in hope to speed alone GREMIO What this gentleman will out-talk us all LUCENTIO Sir, give him head I know he'll prove a jade PETRUCHIO Hortensio, to what end are all these words HORTENSIO Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter TRANIO No, sir but hear I do that he hath two, The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty PETRUCHIO Sir, sir, the first's for me let her go by GREMIO Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules And let it be more than Alcides' twelve PETRUCHIO Sir, understand you this of me in sooth The younges t daughter whom you hearken for Her father keeps from all access of suitors, And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed The younger then is free and not before TRANIO If it be so, sir, that you are the man Must stead us all and me amongst the rest, And if you break the ice and do this feat, Achieve the elder, set the younger free For our access, whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate HORTENSIO Sir, you say well and well you do conceive And since you do profess to be a suitor, You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, To whom we all rest generally beholding TRANIO Sir, I shall not be slack in sign whereof, Please ye we may contrive this afternoon, And quaff carouses to our mistress' health, And do as adversaries do in law, Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends GRUMIO BIONDELLO O excellent motion Fellows, let's be gone HORTENSIO The motion's good indeed and be it so, Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I Padua A room in BAPTISTA'S house  Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA BIANCA Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me That I disdain but for these other gawds, Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself, Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat Or what you will command me will I do, So well I know my duty to my elders KATHARINA Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell Whom thou lovest best see thou dissemble not BIANCA Believe me, sister, of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other KATHARINA Minion, thou liest Is't not Hortensio BIANCA If you affect him, sister, here I swear I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him KATHARINA O then, belike, you fancy riches more You will have Gremio to keep you fair BIANCA Is it for him you do envy me so Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands KATHARINA If that be jest, then all the rest was so Strikes her  Enter BAPTISTA  BAPTISTA Why, how now, dame whence grows this insolence Bianca, stand aside Poor girl she weeps Go ply thy needle meddle not with her For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee When did she cross thee with a bitter word KATHARINA Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged Flies after BIANCA  BAPTISTA What, in my sight Bianca, get thee in Exit BIANCA  KATHARINA What, will you not suffer me Nay, now I see She is your treasure, she must have a husband I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day And for your love to her lead apes in hell Talk not to me I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge Exit  BAPTISTA Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I But who comes here Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books  GREMIO Good morrow, neighbour Baptista BAPTISTA Good morrow, neighbour Gremio God save you, gentlemen PETRUCHIO And you, good sir Pray, have you not a daughter Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous BAPTISTA I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina GREMIO You are too blunt go to it orderly PETRUCHIO You wrong me, Signior Gremio give me leave I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That, hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard And, for an entrance to my entertainment, I do present you with a man of mine, Presenting HORTENSIO  Cunning in music and the mathematics, To instruct her fully in those sciences, Whereof I know she is not ignorant Accept of him, or else you do me wrong His name is Licio, born in Mantua BAPTISTA You're welcome, sir and he, for your good sake But for my daughter Katharina, this I know, She is not for your turn, the more my grief PETRUCHIO I see you do not mean to part with her, Or else you like not of my company BAPTISTA Mistake me not I speak but as I find Whence are you, sir what may I call your name PETRUCHIO Petruchio is my name Antonio's son, A man well known throughout all Italy BAPTISTA I know him well you are welcome for his sake GREMIO Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray, Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too Baccare you are marvellous forward PETRUCHIO O, pardon me, Signior Gremio I would fain be doing GREMIO I doubt it not, sir but you will curse your wooing Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar, Presenting LUCENTIO  that hath been long studying at Rheims as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics his name is Cambio pray, accept his service BAPTISTA A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio Welcome, good Cambio To TRANIO  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming TRANIO Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, That, being a stranger in this city here, Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage, I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo And free access and favour as the rest And, toward the education of your daughters, I here bestow a simple instrument, And this small packet of Greek and Latin books If you accept them, then their worth is great BAPTISTA Lucentio is your name of whence, I pray TRANIO Of Pisa, sir son to Vincentio BAPTISTA A mighty man of Pisa by report I know him well you are very welcome, sir, Take you the lute, and you the set of books You shall go see your pupils presently Holla, within Enter a Servant  Sirrah, lead these gentlemen To my daughters and tell them both, These are their tutors bid them use them well Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following  We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves PETRUCHIO Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have better'd rather than decreased Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife BAPTISTA After my death the one half of my lands, And in possession twenty thousand crowns PETRUCHIO And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand BAPTISTA Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd, That is, her love for that is all in all PETRUCHIO Why, that is nothing for I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all So I to her and so she yields to me For I am rough and woo not like a babe BAPTISTA Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words PETRUCHIO Ay, to the proof as mountains are for winds, That shake not, though they blow perpetually Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke  BAPTISTA How now, my friend why dost thou look so pale HORTENSIO For fear, I promise you, if I look pale BAPTISTA What, will my daughter prove a good musician HORTENSIO I think she'll sooner prove a soldier Iron may hold with her, but never lutes BAPTISTA Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute HORTENSIO Why, no for she hath broke the lute to me I did but tell her she mistook her frets, And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, 'Frets, call you these' quoth she 'I'll fume with them' And, with that word, she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way And there I stood amazed for a while, As on a pillory, looking through the lute While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms, As had she studied to misuse me so PETRUCHIO Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench I love her ten times more than e'er I did O, how I long to have some chat with her BAPTISTA Well, go with me and be not so discomfited Proceed in practise with my younger daughter She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you PETRUCHIO I pray you do Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO  I will attend her here, And woo her with some spirit when she comes Say that she rail why then I'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash'd with dew Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then I'll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married But here she comes and now, Petruchio, speak Enter KATHARINA  Good morrow, Kate for that's your name, I hear KATHARINA Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing They call me Katharina that do talk of me PETRUCHIO You lie, in faith for you are call'd plain Kate, And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs, Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife KATHARINA Moved in good time let him that moved you hither Remove you hence I knew you at the first You were a moveable PETRUCHIO Why, what's a moveable KATHARINA A join'd-stool PETRUCHIO Thou hast hit it come, sit on me KATHARINA Asses are made to bear, and so are you PETRUCHIO Women are made to bear, and so are you KATHARINA No such jade as you, if me you mean PETRUCHIO Alas good Kate, I will not burden thee For, knowing thee to be but young and light-- KATHARINA Too light for such a swain as you to catch And yet as heavy as my weight should be PETRUCHIO Should be should--buzz KATHARINA Well ta'en, and like a buzzard PETRUCHIO O slow-wing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee KATHARINA Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard PETRUCHIO Come, come, you wasp i' faith, you are too angry KATHARINA If I be waspish, best beware my sting PETRUCHIO My remedy is then, to pluck it out KATHARINA Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies, PETRUCHIO Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting In his tail KATHARINA In his tongue PETRUCHIO Whose tongue KATHARINA Yours, if you talk of tails and so farewell PETRUCHIO What, with my tongue in your tail nay, come again, Good Kate I am a gentleman KATHARINA That I'll try She strikes him  PETRUCHIO I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again KATHARINA So may you lose your arms If you strike me, you are no gentleman And if no gentleman, why then no arms PETRUCHIO A herald, Kate O, put me in thy books KATHARINA What is your crest a coxcomb PETRUCHIO A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen KATHARINA No cock of mine you crow too like a craven PETRUCHIO Nay, come, Kate, come you must not look so sour KATHARINA It is my fashion, when I see a crab PETRUCHIO Why, here's no crab and therefore look not sour KATHARINA There is, there is PETRUCHIO Then show it me KATHARINA Had I a glass, I would PETRUCHIO What, you mean my face KATHARINA Well aim'd of such a young one PETRUCHIO Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you KATHARINA Yet you are wither'd PETRUCHIO 'Tis with cares KATHARINA I care not PETRUCHIO Nay, hear you, Kate in sooth you scape not so KATHARINA I chafe you, if I tarry let me go PETRUCHIO No, not a whit I find you passing gentle 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, And now I find report a very liar For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk, But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable Why does the world report that Kate doth limp O slanderous world Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels O, let me see thee walk thou dost not halt KATHARINA Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command PETRUCHIO Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful KATHARINA Where did you study all this goodly speech PETRUCHIO It is extempore, from my mother-wit KATHARINA A witty mother witless else her son PETRUCHIO Am I not wise KATHARINA Yes keep you warm PETRUCHIO Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry 'greed on And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty, Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well, Thou must be married to no man but me For I am he am born to tame you Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates Here comes your father never make denial I must and will have Katharina to my wife Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO  BAPTISTA Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter PETRUCHIO How but well, sir how but well It were impossible I should speed amiss BAPTISTA Why, how now, daughter Katharina in your dumps KATHARINA Call you me daughter now, I promise you You have show'd a tender fatherly regard, To wish me wed to one half lunatic A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out PETRUCHIO Father, 'tis thus yourself and all the world, That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her If she be curst, it is for policy, For she's not froward, but modest as the dove She is not hot, but temperate as the morn For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, That upon Sunday is the wedding-day KATHARINA I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first GREMIO Hark, Petruchio she says she'll see thee hang'd first TRANIO Is this your speeding nay, then, good night our part PETRUCHIO Be patient, gentlemen I choose her for myself If she and I be pleased, what's that to you 'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me O, the kindest Kate She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love O, you are novices 'tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew Give me thy hand, Kate I will unto Venice, To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine BAPTISTA I know not what to say but give me your hands God send you joy, Petruchio 'tis a match GREMIO TRANIO Amen, say we we will be witnesses PETRUCHIO Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu I will to Venice Sunday comes apace We will have rings and things and fine array And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally  GREMIO Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly BAPTISTA Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part, And venture madly on a desperate mart TRANIO 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you 'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas BAPTISTA The gain I seek is, quiet in the match GREMIO No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter Now is the day we long have looked for I am your neighbour, and was suitor first TRANIO And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess GREMIO Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I TRANIO Graybeard, thy love doth freeze GREMIO But thine doth fry Skipper, stand back 'tis age that nourisheth TRANIO But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth BAPTISTA Content you, gentlemen I will compound this strife 'Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca's love Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her GREMIO First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass and all things that belong To house or housekeeping then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion Myself am struck in years, I must confess And if I die to-morrow, this is hers, If whilst I live she will be only mine TRANIO That 'only' came well in Sir, list to me I am my father's heir and only son If I may have your daughter to my wife, I'll leave her houses three or four as good, Within rich Pisa walls, as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio GREMIO Two thousand ducats by the year of land My land amounts not to so much in all That she shall have besides an argosy That now is lying in Marseilles' road What, have I choked you with an argosy TRANIO Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies besides two galliases, And twelve tight galleys these I will assure her, And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next GREMIO Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more And she can have no more than all I have If you like me, she shall have me and mine TRANIO Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, By your firm promise Gremio is out-vied BAPTISTA I must confess your offer is the best And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own else, you must pardon me, if you should die before him, where's her dower TRANIO That's but a cavil he is old, I young GREMIO And may not young men die, as well as old BAPTISTA Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved on Sunday next you know My daughter Katharina is to be married Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca Be bride to you, if you this assurance If not, Signior Gremio And so, I take my leave, and thank you both GREMIO Adieu, good neighbour Exit BAPTISTA  Now I fear thee not Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all, and in his waning age Set foot under thy table tut, a toy An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy Exit  TRANIO A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide Yet I have faced it with a card of ten 'Tis in my head to do my master good I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio' And that's a wonder fathers commonly Do get their children but in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning Exit  ACT III  SCENE I Padua BAPTISTA'S house  Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA LUCENTIO Fiddler, forbear you grow too forward, sir Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal HORTENSIO But, wrangling pedant, this is The patroness of heavenly harmony Then give me leave to have prerogative And when in music we have spent an hour, Your lecture shall have leisure for as much LUCENTIO Preposterous ass, that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordain'd Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain Then give me leave to read philosophy, And while I pause, serve in your harmony HORTENSIO Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine BIANCA Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong, To strive for that which resteth in my choice I am no breeching scholar in the schools I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times, But learn my lessons as I please myself And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down Take you your instrument, play you the whiles His lecture will be done ere you have tuned HORTENSIO You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune LUCENTIO That will be never tune your instrument BIANCA Where left we last LUCENTIO Here, madam 'Hic ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis' BIANCA Construe them LUCENTIO 'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa, 'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love 'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,' bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might beguile the old pantaloon HORTENSIO Madam, my instrument's in tune BIANCA Let's hear O fie the treble jars LUCENTIO Spit in the hole, man, and tune again BIANCA Now let me see if I can construe it 'Hic ibat Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I trust you not 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' despair not HORTENSIO Madam, 'tis now in tune LUCENTIO All but the base HORTENSIO The base is right 'tis the base knave that jars Aside  How fiery and forward our pedant is Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet BIANCA In time I may believe, yet I mistrust LUCENTIO Mistrust it not for, sure, AEacides Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather BIANCA I must believe my master else, I promise you, I should be arguing still upon that doubt But let it rest Now, Licio, to you Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both HORTENSIO You may go walk, and give me leave a while My lessons make no music in three parts LUCENTIO Are you so formal, sir well, I must wait, Aside  And watch withal for, but I be deceived, Our fine musician groweth amorous HORTENSIO Madam, before you touch the instrument, To learn the order of my fingering, I must begin with rudiments of art To teach you gamut in a briefer sort, More pleasant, pithy and effectual, Than hath been taught by any of my trade And there it is in writing, fairly drawn BIANCA Why, I am past my gamut long ago HORTENSIO Yet read the gamut of Hortensio BIANCA Reads ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord, 'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion 'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord, 'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection 'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I 'E la mi,' show pity, or I die' Call you this gamut tut, I like it not Old fashions please me best I am not so nice, To change true rules for old inventions Enter a Servant  Servant Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister's chamber up You know to-morrow is the wedding-day BIANCA Farewell, sweet masters both I must be gone Exeunt BIANCA and Servant  LUCENTIO Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay Exit  HORTENSIO But I have cause to pry into this pedant Methinks he looks as though he were in love Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale, Seize thee that list if once I find thee ranging, Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing Exit  SCENE II Padua Before BAPTISTA'S house  Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants BAPTISTA To TRANIO Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day That Katharina and Petruchio should be married, And yet we hear not of our son-in-law What will be said what mockery will it be, To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage What says Lucentio to this shame of ours KATHARINA No shame but mine I must, forsooth, be forced To give my hand opposed against my heart Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior And, to be noted for a merry man, He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd Now must the world point at poor Katharina, And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife, If it would please him come and marry her' TRANIO Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest KATHARINA Would Katharina had never seen him though Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others  BAPTISTA Go, girl I cannot blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint, Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour Enter BIONDELLO  BIONDELLO Master, master news, old news, and such news as you never heard of BAPTISTA Is it new and old too how may that be BIONDELLO Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming BAPTISTA Is he come BIONDELLO Why, no, sir BAPTISTA What then BIONDELLO He is coming BAPTISTA When will he be here BIONDELLO When he stands where I am and sees you there TRANIO But say, what to thine old news BIONDELLO Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread BAPTISTA Who comes with him BIONDELLO O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and 'the humour of forty fancies' pricked in't for a feather a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey TRANIO 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd BAPTISTA I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes BIONDELLO Why, sir, he comes not BAPTISTA Didst thou not say he comes BIONDELLO Who that Petruchio came BAPTISTA Ay, that Petruchio came BIONDELLO No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back BAPTISTA Why, that's all one BIONDELLO Nay, by Saint Jamy, I hold you a penny, A horse and a man Is more than one, And yet not many Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO  PETRUCHIO Come, where be these gallants who's at home BAPTISTA You are welcome, sir PETRUCHIO And yet I come not well BAPTISTA And yet you halt not TRANIO Not so well apparell'd As I wish you were PETRUCHIO Were it better, I should rush in thus But where is Kate where is my lovely bride How does my father Gentles, methinks you frown And wherefore gaze this goodly company, As if they saw some wondrous monument,

done, he took the bride about the neck And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo And I seeing this came thence for very shame And after me, I know,

undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets Ay, and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her And in conclusion she shall watch all night And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl And with the clamour keep her still awake This is a way to kill a wife with

throat, if he say I said so Tailor Reads 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown' GRUMIO Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread I said a gown PETRUCHIO Proceed Tailor Reads 'With a small compassed cape' GRUMIO I confess the cape Tailor Reads 'With a trunk sleeve' GRUMIO I confess two sleeves Tailor Reads 'The sleeves curiously

habiliments Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, So honour peereth in the meanest habit What is the

this poor furniture and mean array if thou account'st it shame lay it on me And therefore frolic we will hence forthwith, To feast and sport us at thy father's house Go, call my men, and let us

daughter and himself And, for the good report I hear of you And for the love he beareth to your daughter And she to him, to stay him not too long, I am content, in a good father's care, To have him match'd and if you please to like No worse than I, upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow'd For curious I cannot be with you, Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well BAPTISTA Sir, pardon me in what I have to say Your plainness and your shortness please me well Right true it is, your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections And therefore, if you say no more than this, That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower, The match is made, and all is done Your son shall have my daughter with consent TRANIO I thank you, sir Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part's agreement stand BAPTISTA Not in

KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet LUCENTIO At last, though long, our jarring notes agree And time it is, when raging war

loving widow, Feast with the best, and welcome to my house My banquet is to close our stomachs up, After our great good cheer Pray you, sit down For now we sit to chat as well as eat PETRUCHIO Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat BAPTISTA Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio PETRUCHIO Padua affords nothing but what is kind HORTENSIO For both our sakes, I would that word were true PETRUCHIO Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow Widow Then never trust me, if I be afeard PETRUCHIO You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you Widow He that is giddy thinks the world turns round PETRUCHIO Roundly replied KATHARINA Mistress, how mean you that Widow Thus I conceive by him PETRUCHIO Conceives by me How likes Hortensio that HORTENSIO My

bitter jest or two BIANCA Am I your bird I mean to shift my bush And then pursue me as you draw your bow You are welcome all Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow  PETRUCHIO She hath prevented me Here, Signior Tranio This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd TRANIO O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound, Which runs himself and catches for his master PETRUCHIO A good swift simile, but something currish TRANIO 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay BAPTISTA O ho, Petruchio Tranio hits you now LUCENTIO I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio HORTENSIO Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here PETRUCHIO A' has a little gall'd me, I confess And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright BAPTISTA Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all PETRUCHIO Well, I say no and therefore for assurance Let's each one send unto his wife And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her, Shall win the wager which we will propose HORTENSIO Content What is the wager LUCENTIO Twenty crowns PETRUCHIO Twenty crowns I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife LUCENTIO A hundred then HORTENSIO Content PETRUCHIO A match 'tis done HORTENSIO Who shall begin LUCENTIO That will I Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me BIONDELLO I go Exit  BAPTISTA Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes LUCENTIO I'll have no halves I'll bear it all myself Re-enter

too Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse PETRUCHIO I hope better HORTENSIO Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith Exit BIONDELLO  PETRUCHIO O, ho entreat her Nay, then she must needs come HORTENSIO I am afraid, sir, Do what you can, yours will not be entreated Re-enter BIONDELLO  Now, where's my wife BIONDELLO She says you have some goodly jest in hand She will not come she bids you come to her PETRUCHIO Worse and worse she will not come O vile, Intolerable, not to be endured Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress Say, I command her to come to me Exit GRUMIO

What is your will, sir, that you send for me PETRUCHIO Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife KATHARINA They sit conferring by the parlor fire PETRUCHIO Go fetch them hither if they deny to come Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands Away, I say, and bring them hither straight Exit KATHARINA  LUCENTIO Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder HORTENSIO And so it is I wonder what it bodes PETRUCHIO Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life, And awful rule and right supremacy And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy BAPTISTA Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio The wager thou hast won and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter, For she is changed, as she had never been PETRUCHIO Nay, I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience, Her new-built virtue and obedience See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow  Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot Widow Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass BIANCA Fie what a foolish duty call you this LUCENTIO I would your duty were as foolish too The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time BIANCA The more fool you, for laying on my duty PETRUCHIO Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands Widow Come, come, you're mocking we will have no telling PETRUCHIO Come on, I say and first begin with her Widow She shall not PETRUCHIO I say she shall and first begin with her KATHARINA Fie, fie unknit that threatening unkind brow, And dart not scornful glances from those eyes, To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, And in no sense is meet or amiable A woman moved is like a fountain troubled, Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, Thy head, thy sovereign one that cares for thee, And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land, To watch the night in storms, the day in cold, Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love, fair looks and true obedience Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, And not obedient to his honest will, What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway, When they are bound to serve, love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come, come, you froward and unable worms My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, And place your hands below your husband's foot In token of which duty, if he please, My hand is ready may it do him ease PETRUCHIO Why, there's a wench Come on, and kiss me, Kate LUCENTIO Well, go thy ways, old lad for thou shalt ha't VINCENTIO 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward LUCENTIO But a harsh hearing when women are froward PETRUCHIO Come, Kate, we'll to bed We three are married, but you two are sped To LUCENTIO  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white And, being a winner, God give you good night Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA  HORTENSIO Now, go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew LUCENTIO 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so Exeunt  ACT I  SCENE I Athens The palace of THESEUS  Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants THESEUS Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace four happy days bring in Another moon but, O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes she lingers my desires, Like to a step-dame or a dowager Long withering out a young man revenue HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep themselves in night Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities THESEUS Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp Exit PHILOSTRATE  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword, And won thy love, doing thee injuries But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph and with revelling Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS  EGEUS Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke THESEUS Thanks, good Egeus what's the news with thee EGEUS Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia Stand forth, Demetrius My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her Stand forth, Lysander and my gracious duke, This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchanged love-tokens with my child Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung, With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And stolen the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart, Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn harshness and, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, As she is mine, I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided in that case THESEUS What say you, Hermia be advised fair maid To you your father should be as a god One that composed your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it Demetrius is a worthy gentleman HERMIA So is Lysander THESEUS In himself he is But in this kind, wanting your father's voice, The other must be held the worthier HERMIA I would my father look'd but with my eyes THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look HERMIA I do entreat your grace to pardon me I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concern my modesty, In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood, To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd, Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness HERMIA So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty THESEUS Take time to pause and, by the next new moon-- The sealing-day betwixt my love and me, For everlasting bond of fellowship-- Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life DEMETRIUS Relent, sweet Hermia and, Lysander, yield Thy crazed title to my certain right LYSANDER You have her father's love, Demetrius Let me have Hermia's do you marry him EGEUS Scornful Lysander true, he hath my love, And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius LYSANDER I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possess'd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd, If not with vantage, as Demetrius' And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am beloved of beauteous Hermia Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, And won her soul and she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof But, being over-full of self-affairs, My mind did lose it But, Demetrius, come And come, Egeus you shall go with me, I have some private schooling for you both For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father's will Or else the law of Athens yields you up-- Which by no means we may extenuate-- To death, or to a vow of single life Come, my Hippolyta what cheer, my love Demetrius and Egeus, go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA  LYSANDER How now, my love why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fast HERMIA Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes LYSANDER Ay me for aught that I could ever read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth But, either it was different in blood,-- HERMIA O cross too high to be enthrall'd to low LYSANDER Or else misgraffed in respect of years,-- HERMIA O spite too old to be engaged to young LYSANDER Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,-- HERMIA O hell to choose love by another's eyes LYSANDER Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold' The jaws of darkness do devour it up So quick bright things come to confusion HERMIA If then true lovers have been ever cross'd, It stands as an edict in destiny Then let us teach our trial patience, Because it is a customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers LYSANDER A good persuasion therefore, hear me, Hermia I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child From Athens is her house remote seven leagues And she respects me as her only son There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then, Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night And in the wood, a league without the town, Where I did meet thee once with Helena, To do observance to a morn of May, There will I stay for thee HERMIA My good Lysander I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus' doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen, When the false Troyan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke, In number more than ever women spoke, In that same place thou hast appointed me, To-morrow truly will I meet with thee LYSANDER Keep promise, love Look, here comes Helena Enter HELENA  HERMIA God speed fair Helena whither away HELENA Call you me fair that fair again unsay Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear Sickness is catching O, were favour so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I'd give to be to you translated O, teach me how you look, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart HERMIA I frown upon him, yet he loves me still HELENA O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill HERMIA I give him curses, yet he gives me love HELENA O that my prayers could such affection move HERMIA The more I hate, the more he follows me HELENA The more I love, the more he hateth me HERMIA His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine HELENA None, but your beauty would that fault were mine HERMIA Take comfort he no more shall see my face Lysander and myself will fly this place Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me O, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell LYSANDER Helen, to you our minds we will unfold To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass, A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal, Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal HERMIA And in the wood, where often you and I Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, To seek new friends and stranger companies Farewell, sweet playfellow pray thou for us And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius Keep word, Lysander we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight LYSANDER I will, my Hermia Exit HERMIA  Helena, adieu As you on him, Demetrius dote on you Exit  HELENA How happy some o'er other some can be Through Athens I am thought as fair as she But what of that Demetrius thinks not so He will not know what all but he do know And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities Things base and vile, folding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste And therefore is Love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguiled As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured every where For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight Then to the wood will he to-morrow night Pursue her and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again Exit  SCENE II Athens QUINCE'S house  Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING QUINCE Is all our company here BOTTOM You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip QUINCE Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his wedding-day at night BOTTOM First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point QUINCE Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby BOTTOM A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll Masters, spread yourselves QUINCE Answer as I call you Nick Bottom, the weaver BOTTOM Ready Name what part I am for, and proceed QUINCE You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus BOTTOM What is Pyramus a lover, or a tyrant QUINCE A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love BOTTOM That will ask some tears in the true performing of it if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms, I will condole in some measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates And Phibbus' car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates This was lofty Now name the rest of the players This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein a lover is more condoling QUINCE Francis Flute, the bellows-mender FLUTE Here, Peter Quince QUINCE Flute, you must take Thisby on you FLUTE What is Thisby a wandering knight QUINCE It is the lady that Pyramus must love FLUTE Nay, faith, let me not play a woman I have a beard coming QUINCE That's all one you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will BOTTOM An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll speak in a monstrous little voice 'Thisne, Thisne' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear thy Thisby dear, and lady dear' QUINCE No, no you must play Pyramus and, Flute, you Thisby BOTTOM Well, proceed QUINCE Robin Starveling, the tailor STARVELING Here, Peter Quince QUINCE Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother Tom Snout, the tinker SNOUT Here, Peter Quince QUINCE You, Pyramus' father myself, Thisby's father Snug, the joiner you, the lion's part and, I hope, here is a play fitted SNUG Have you the lion's part written pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study QUINCE You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring BOTTOM Let me play the lion too I will roar, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me I will roar, that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again' QUINCE An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all ALL That would hang us, every mother's son BOTTOM I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale QUINCE You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day a most lovely gentleman-like man therefore you must needs play Pyramus BOTTOM Well, I will undertake it What beard were I best to play it in QUINCE Why, what you will BOTTOM I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow QUINCE Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced But, masters, here are your parts and I am to entreat you, request you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight there will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants I pray you, fail me not BOTTOM We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously Take pains be perfect adieu QUINCE At the duke's oak we meet BOTTOM Enough hold or cut bow-strings Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I A wood near Athens  Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK PUCK How now, spirit whither wander you Fairy Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moon's sphere And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green The cowslips tall her pensioners be In their gold coats spots you see Those be rubies, fairy favours, In those freckles live their savours I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear Farewell, thou lob of spirits I'll be gone Our queen and all our elves come here anon PUCK The king doth keep his revels here to-night Take heed the queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king She never had so sweet a changeling And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild But she perforce withholds the loved boy, Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy And now they never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, But, they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there Fairy Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck Are not you he PUCK Thou speak'st aright I am that merry wanderer of the night I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab, And when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there But, room, fairy here comes Oberon Fairy And here my mistress Would that he were gone Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train from the other, TITANIA, with hers  OBERON Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania TITANIA What, jealous Oberon Fairies, skip hence I have forsworn his bed and company OBERON Tarry, rash wanton am not I thy lord TITANIA Then I must be thy lady but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land, And in the shape of Corin sat all day, Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida Why art thou here, Come from the farthest Steppe of India But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity OBERON How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia, whom he ravished And make him with fair AEgle break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy And never, since the middle summer's spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead, By paved fountain or by rushy brook, Or in the beached margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And crows are fatted with the murrion flock The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary-headed frosts Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set the spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension We are their parents and original OBERON Do you amend it then it lies in you Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my henchman TITANIA Set your heart at rest The fairy land buys not the child of me His mother was a votaress of my order And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, Full often hath she gossip'd by my side, And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, Marking the embarked traders on the flood, When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,-- Would imitate, and sail upon the land, To fetch me trifles, and return again, As from a voyage, rich with merchandise But she, being mortal, of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay TITANIA Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels, go with us If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts OBERON Give me that boy, and I will go with thee TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies, away We shall chide downright, if I longer stay Exit TITANIA with her train  OBERON Well, go thy way thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck, come hither Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To hear the sea-maid's music PUCK I remember OBERON That very time I saw, but thou couldst not, Flying between the cold moon and the earth, Cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west, And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow, As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound, And maidens call it love-in-idleness Fetch me that flower the herb I shew'd thee once The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league PUCK I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes Exit  OBERON Having once this juice, I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon, Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey, or on busy ape, She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight, As I can take it with another herb, I'll make her render up her page to me But who comes here I am invisible And I will overhear their conference Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him  DEMETRIUS I love thee not, therefore pursue me not Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood And here am I, and wode within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more HELENA You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you DEMETRIUS Do I entice you do I speak you fair Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you HELENA And even for that do I love you the more I am your spaniel and, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you What worser place can I beg in your love,-- And yet a place of high respect with me,-- Than to be used as you use your dog DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on thee HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much, To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity HELENA Your virtue is my privilege for that It is not night when I do see your face, Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone, When all the world is here to look on me DEMETRIUS I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will, the story shall be changed Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed, When cowardice pursues and valour flies DEMETRIUS I will not stay thy questions let me go Or, if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood HELENA Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do me mischief Fie, Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex We cannot fight for love, as men may do We should be wood and were not made to woo Exit DEMETRIUS  I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well Exit  OBERON Fare thee well, nymph ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love Re-enter PUCK  Hast thou the flower there Welcome, wanderer PUCK Ay, there it is OBERON I pray thee, give it me I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow PUCK Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so Exeunt  SCENE II Another part of the wood  Enter TITANIA, with her train TITANIA Come, now a roundel and a fairy song Then, for the third part of a minute, hence Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds, Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings, To make my small elves coats, and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest The Fairies sing  You spotted snakes with double tongue, Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong, Come not near our fairy queen Philomel, with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby Never harm, Nor spell nor charm, Come our lovely lady nigh So, good night, with lullaby Weaving spiders, come not here Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence Beetles black, approach not near Worm nor snail, do no offence Philomel, with melody,  c Fairy Hence, away now all is well One aloof stand sentinel Exeunt Fairies TITANIA sleeps  Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids  OBERON What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true-love take, Love and languish for his sake Be it ounce, or cat, or bear, Pard, or boar with bristled hair, In thy eye that shall appear When thou wakest, it is thy dear Wake when some vile thing is near Exit  Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA  LYSANDER Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood And to speak troth, I have forgot our way We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good, And tarry for the comfort of the day HERMIA Be it so, Lysander find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head LYSANDER One turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth HERMIA Nay, good Lysander for my sake, my dear, Lie further off yet, do not lie so near LYSANDER O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence Love takes the meaning in love's conference I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it Two bosoms interchained with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth Then by your side no bed-room me deny For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie HERMIA Lysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty, Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid, So far be distant and, good night, sweet friend Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end LYSANDER Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest HERMIA With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd They sleep  Enter PUCK  PUCK Through the forest have I gone But Athenian found I none, On whose eyes I might approve This flower's force in stirring love Night and silence--Who is here Weeds of Athens he doth wear This is he, my master said, Despised the Athenian maid And here the maiden, sleeping sound, On the dank and dirty ground Pretty soul she durst not lie Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy Churl, upon thy eyes I throw All the power this charm doth owe When thou wakest, let love forbid Sleep his seat on thy eyelid So awake when I am gone For I must now to Oberon Exit  Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running  HELENA Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius DEMETRIUS I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus HELENA O, wilt thou darkling leave me do not so DEMETRIUS Stay, on thy peril I alone will go Exit  HELENA O, I am out of breath in this fond chase The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies For she hath blessed and attractive eyes How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers No, no, I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster fly my presence thus What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne But who is here Lysander on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood, no wound Lysander if you live, good sir, awake LYSANDER Awaking And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake Transparent Helena Nature shows art, That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart Where is Demetrius O, how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword HELENA Do not say so, Lysander say not so What though he love your Hermia Lord, what though Yet Hermia still loves you then be content LYSANDER Content with Hermia No I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent Not Hermia but Helena I love Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason sway'd And reason says you are the worthier maid Things growing are not ripe until their season So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill, Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook Love's stories written in love's richest book HELENA Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, That I did never, no, nor never can, Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo But fare you well perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness O, that a lady, of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused Exit  LYSANDER She sees not Hermia Hermia, sleep thou there And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings, Or as tie heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive, So thou, my surfeit and my heresy, Of all be hated, but the most of me And, all my powers, address your love and might To honour Helen and to be her knight Exit  HERMIA Awaking Help me, Lysander, help me do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast Ay me, for pity what a dream was here Lysander, look how I do quake with fear Methought a serpent eat my heart away, And you sat smiling at his cruel pray Lysander what, removed Lysander lord What, out of hearing gone no sound, no word Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear Speak, of all loves I swoon almost with fear No then I well perceive you all not nigh Either death or you I'll find immediately Exit  ACT III  SCENE I The wood TITANIA lying asleep  Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING BOTTOM Are we all met QUINCE Pat, pat and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke BOTTOM Peter Quince,-- QUINCE What sayest thou, bully Bottom BOTTOM There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide How answer you that SNOUT By'r lakin, a parlous fear STARVELING I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done BOTTOM Not a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed and, for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver this will put them out of fear QUINCE Well, we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six BOTTOM No, make it two more let it be written in eight and eight SNOUT Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion STARVELING I fear it, I promise you BOTTOM Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in--God shield us--a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to 't SNOUT Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion BOTTOM Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble my life for yours If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a man as other men are' and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner QUINCE Well it shall be so But there is two hard things that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber for, you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight SNOUT Doth the moon shine that night we play our play BOTTOM A calendar, a calendar look in the almanac find out moonshine, find out moonshine QUINCE Yes, it doth shine that night BOTTOM Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon may shine in at the casement QUINCE Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine Then, there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall SNOUT You can never bring in a wall What say you, Bottom BOTTOM Some man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper QUINCE If that may be, then all is well Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts Pyramus, you begin when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue Enter PUCK behind  PUCK What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here, So near the cradle of the fairy queen What, a play toward I'll be an auditor An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause QUINCE Speak, Pyramus Thisby, stand forth BOTTOM Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,-- QUINCE Odours, odours BOTTOM --odours savours sweet So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear But hark, a voice stay thou but here awhile, And by and by I will to thee appear Exit  PUCK A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here Exit  FLUTE Must I speak now QUINCE Ay, marry, must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again FLUTE Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse that yet would never tire, I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb QUINCE 'Ninus' tomb,' man why, you must not speak that yet that you answer to Pyramus you speak all your part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter your cue is past it is, 'never tire' FLUTE O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head  BOTTOM If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine QUINCE O monstrous O strange we are haunted Pray, masters fly, masters Help Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING  PUCK I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round, Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn Exit  BOTTOM Why do they run away this is a knavery of them to make me afeard Re-enter SNOUT  SNOUT O Bottom, thou art changed what do I see on thee BOTTOM What do you see you see an asshead of your own, do you Exit SNOUT  Re-enter QUINCE  QUINCE Bless thee, Bottom bless thee thou art translated Exit  BOTTOM I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me, if they could But I will not stir from this place, do what they can I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid Sings  The ousel cock so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill,-- TITANIA Awaking What angel wakes me from my flowery bed BOTTOM Sings The finch, the sparrow and the lark, The plain-song cuckoo gray, Whose note full many a man doth mark, And dares not answer nay-- for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird who would give a bird the lie, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so TITANIA I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee BOTTOM Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends Nay, I can gleek upon occasion TITANIA Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful BOTTOM Not so, neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn TITANIA Out of this wood do not desire to go Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no I am a spirit of no common rate The summer still doth tend upon my state And I do love thee therefore, go with me I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee, And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED  PEASEBLOSSOM Ready COBWEB And I MOTH And I MUSTARDSEED And I ALL Where shall we go TITANIA Be kind and courteous to this gentleman Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, To have my love to bed and to arise And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies PEASEBLOSSOM Hail, mortal

giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now I desire your more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed TITANIA Come, wait upon him lead him to my bower The moon methinks looks with a watery eye And when she weeps, weeps every little flower, Lamenting some enforced chastity Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently Exeunt  SCENE II Another part of the wood  Enter OBERON OBERON I wonder if Titania be awaked Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity Enter PUCK  Here comes my messenger How now, mad spirit What night-rule now about this haunted grove PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Pyramus presented, in their sport Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake When I did him at this advantage take, An ass's nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisbe must be answered, And forth my mimic comes When they him spy, As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, Rising and cawing at the gun's report, Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky, So, at his sight, away his fellows fly And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear, And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment, so it came to pass, Titania waked and straightway loved an ass OBERON This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do PUCK I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,-- And the Athenian woman by his side That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS  OBERON Stand close this is the same Athenian PUCK This is the woman, but not this the man DEMETRIUS O, why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse, If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bored and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother's noontide with Antipodes It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim DEMETRIUS So should the murder'd look, and so should I, Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere HERMIA What's this to my Lysander where is he Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds HERMIA Out, dog out, cur thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden's patience Hast thou slain him, then Henceforth be never number'd among men O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake, And hast thou kill'd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm, an adder, do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung DEMETRIUS You spend your passion on a misprised mood I am not guilty of Lysander's blood Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell HERMIA I pray thee, tell me then that he is well DEMETRIUS An if I could, what should I get therefore HERMIA A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more, whether he be dead or no Exit  DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down and sleeps  OBERON What hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true PUCK Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, A million fail, confounding oath on oath OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer, With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here I'll charm his eyes against she do appear PUCK I go, I go look how I go, Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow Exit  OBERON Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery, Sink in apple of his eye When his love he doth espy, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy Re-enter PUCK  PUCK Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand And the youth, mistook by me, Pleading for a lover's fee Shall we their fond pageant see Lord, what fools these mortals be OBERON Stand aside the noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake PUCK Then will two at once woo one That must needs be sport alone And those things do best please me That befal preposterously Enter LYSANDER and HELENA  LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look, when I vow, I weep and vows so born, In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you, Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true HELENA You do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray These vows are Hermia's will you give her o'er Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me, put in two scales, Will even weigh, and both as light as tales LYSANDER I had no judgment when to her I swore HELENA Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er LYSANDER Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you DEMETRIUS Awaking O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O, how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow, Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand O, let me kiss This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss HELENA O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you we re civil and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me, as I know you do, But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men, as men you are in show, You would not use a gentle lady so To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals, and love Hermia And now both rivals, to mock Helena A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes With your derision none of noble sort Would so offend a virgin, and extort A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport LYSANDER You are unkind, Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia this you know I know And here, with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermia's love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath, Whom I do love and will do till my death HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath DEMETRIUS Lysander, keep thy Hermia I will none If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd, And now to Helen is it home return'd, There to remain LYSANDER Helen, it is not so DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear Look, where thy love comes yonder is thy dear Re-enter HERMIA  HERMIA Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so LYSANDER Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side LYSANDER Lysander's love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light Why seek'st thou me could not this make thee know, The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so HERMIA You speak not as you think it cannot be HELENA Lo, she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport, in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspired, have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us,--O, is it all forgot All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds, Had been incorporate So we grow together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries moulded on one stem So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one and crowned with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder, To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury HERMIA I am amazed at your passionate words I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me HELENA Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love, Demetrius, Who even but now did spurn me with his foot, To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare, Precious, celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates and wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent What thought I be not so in grace as you, So hung upon with love, so fortunate, But miserable most, to love unloved This you should pity rather than despise HERNIA I understand not what you mean by this HELENA Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument But fare ye well 'tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy LYSANDER Stay, gentle Helena hear my excuse My love, my life my soul, fair Helena HELENA O excellent HERMIA Sweet, do not scorn her so DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat, I can compel LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen, I love thee by my life, I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee, To prove him false that says I love thee not DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do LYSANDER If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too DEMETRIUS Quick, come HERMIA Lysander, whereto tends all this LYSANDER Away, you Ethiope DEMETRIUS No, no he'll   Seem to break loose take on as you would follow, But yet come not you are a tame man, go LYSANDER Hang off, thou cat, thou burr vile thing, let loose, Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent HERMIA Why are you grown so rude what change is this Sweet love,-- LYSANDER Thy love out, tawny Tartar, out Out, loathed medicine hated potion, hence HERMIA Do you not jest HELENA Yes, sooth and so do you LYSANDER Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond, for I perceive A weak bond holds you I'll not trust your word LYSANDER What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so HERMIA What, can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me wherefore O me what news, my love Am not I Hermia are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you loved me yet since night you left me Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid-- In earnest, shall I say LYSANDER Ay, by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt Be certain, nothing truer 'tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena HERMIA O me you juggler you canker-blossom You thief of love what, have you come by night And stolen my love's heart from him HELENA Fine, i'faith Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness What, will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie, fie you counterfeit, you puppet, you HERMIA Puppet why so ay, that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urged her height And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I, thou painted maypole speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes HELENA I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her HERMIA Lower hark, again HELENA Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you, Hermia, Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you Save that, in love unto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth unto this wood He follow'd you for love I follow'd him But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too And now, so you will let me quiet go, To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further let me go You see how simple and how fond I am HERMIA Why, get you gone who is't that hinders you HELENA A foolish heart, that I leave here behind HERMIA What, with Lysander HELENA With Demetrius LYSANDER Be not afraid she shall not harm thee, Helena DEMETRIUS No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part HELENA O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school And though she be but little, she is fierce HERMIA 'Little' again nothing but 'low' and 'little' Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to her LYSANDER Get you gone, you dwarf You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made You bead, you acorn DEMETRIUS You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services Let her alone speak not of Helena Take not her part for, if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it LYSANDER Now she holds me not Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena DEMETRIUS Follow nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS  HERMIA You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you Nay, go not back HELENA I will not trust you, I, Nor longer stay in your curst company Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray, My legs are longer though, to run away Exit  HERMIA I am amazed, and know not what to say Exit  OBERON This is thy negligence still thou mistakest, Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully PUCK Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment be had on And so far blameless proves my enterprise, That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport OBERON Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus, Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, To take from thence all error with his might, And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight When they next wake, all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision, And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, With league whose date till death shall never end Whiles I in this affair do thee employ, I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmed eye release From monster's view, and all things shall be peace PUCK My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast, And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there, Troop home to churchyards damned spirits all, That in crossways and floods have burial, Already to their wormy beds are gone For fear lest day should look their shames upon, They willfully themselves exile from light And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night OBERON But we are spirits of another sort I with the morning's love have oft made sport, And, like a forester, the groves may tread, Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams But, notwithstanding, haste make no delay We may effect this business yet ere day Exit  PUCK Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down I am fear'd in field and town Goblin, lead them up and down Here comes one Re-enter LYSANDER  LYSANDER Where art thou, proud Demetrius speak thou now PUCK Here, villain drawn and ready Where art thou LYSANDER I will be with thee straight PUCK Follow me, then, To plainer ground Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice  Re-enter DEMETRIUS  DEMETRIUS Lysander speak again Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head PUCK Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, And wilt not come Come, recreant come, thou child I'll whip thee with a rod he is defiled That draws a sword on thee DEMETRIUS Yea, art thou there PUCK Follow my voice we'll try no manhood here Exeunt  Re-enter LYSANDER  LYSANDER He goes before me and still dares me on When I come where he calls, then he is gone The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly That fallen am I in dark uneven way, And here will rest me Lies down  Come, thou gentle day For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite Sleeps  Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS  PUCK Ho, ho, ho Coward, why comest thou not DEMETRIUS Abide me, if thou darest for well I wot Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place, And darest not stand, nor look me in the face Where art thou now PUCK Come hither I am here DEMETRIUS Nay, then, thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear, If ever I thy face by daylight see Now, go thy way Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed By day's approach look to be visited Lies down and sleeps  Re-enter HELENA  HELENA O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hour Shine comforts from the east, That I may back to Athens by daylight, From these that my poor company detest And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, Steal me awhile from mine own company Lies down and sleeps  PUCK Yet but three Come one more Two of both kinds make up four Here she comes, curst and sad Cupid is a knavish lad, Thus to make poor females mad Re-enter HERMIA  HERMIA Never so weary, never so in woe, Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers, I can no further crawl, no further go My legs can keep no pace with my desires Here will I rest me till the break of day Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray Lies down and sleeps  PUCK On the ground Sleep sound I'll apply To your eye, Gentle lover, remedy Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes  When thou wakest, Thou takest True delight In the sight Of thy former lady's eye And the country proverb known, That every man should take his own, In your waking shall be shown Jack shall have Jill Nought shall go ill The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well Exit  ACT IV  SCENE I The same LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA  lying asleep Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM PEASEBLOSSOM,

Enter PUCK  OBERON Advancing Welcome, good Robin See'st thou this sweet sight Her dotage now I do begin to pity For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begg'd my patience, I then did ask of her her changeling child Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That, he awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream But first I will release the fairy queen Be as thou wast wont to be See as thou wast wont to see Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower Hath such force and blessed power Now, my Titania wake you, my sweet queen TITANIA My Oberon what visions have I seen Methought I was enamour'd of an ass OBERON There lies your love TITANIA How came these things to pass

sleepers be Now thou and I are new in amity, And will to-morrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly, And bless it to all fair prosperity There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity PUCK Fairy king, attend, and mark I do hear the morning lark OBERON Then, my queen, in silence sad, Trip we after the night's shade We the globe can compass soon, Swifter than the wandering moon TITANIA Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground Exeunt  Horns winded within  Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train  THESEUS Go, one of you, find out the forester For now our observation is perform'd And since we have the vaward of the day, My love shall hear the music of my hounds Uncouple in the western valley let them go Dispatch, I say, and find the forester Exit an Attendant  We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction HIPPOLYTA I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta never did I hear Such gallant chiding for, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder THESEUS My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells, Each under each A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly Judge when you hear But, soft what nymphs are these EGEUS My lord, this is my daughter here asleep And this, Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena, old Nedar's Helena I wonder of their being here together THESEUS No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May, and hearing our intent, Came here in grace our solemnity But speak, Egeus is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice EGEUS It is, my lord THESEUS Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns Horns and shout within LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up  Good morrow, friends Saint Valentine is past Begin these wood-birds but to couple now LYSANDER Pardon, my lord THESEUS I pray you all, stand up I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so far from jealousy, To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity LYSANDER My lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half waking but as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here But, as I think,--for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is,-- I came with Hermia hither our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might, Without the peril of the Athenian law EGEUS Enough, enough, my lord you have enough I beg the law, the law, upon his head They would have stolen away they would, Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me, You of your wife and me of my consent, Of my consent that she should be your wife DEMETRIUS My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither follow'd them, Fair Helena in fancy following me But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,-- But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia, Melted as the snow, seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena To her, my lord, Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food But, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it THESEUS Fair lovers, you are fortunately met Of this discourse we more will hear anon Egeus, I will overbear your will For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purposed hunting shall be set aside Away with us to Athens three and three, We'll hold a feast in great solemnity Come, Hippolyta Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train  DEMETRIUS These things seem small and undistinguishable, HERMIA Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When every thing seems double HELENA So methinks And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, Mine own, and not mine own DEMETRIUS Are you sure That we are awake It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream Do not you think The duke was here, and bid us follow him HERMIA Yea and my father HELENA And Hippolyta LYSANDER And he did bid us follow to the temple DEMETRIUS Why, then, we are awake let's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams Exeunt  BOTTOM Awaking When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus' Heigh-ho Peter Quince Flute, the bellows-mender Snout, the tinker Starveling God's my life, stolen hence, and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was--there is no man can tell what Methought I was,--and methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death Exit  SCENE II Athens QUINCE'S

the play is marred it goes not forward, doth it QUINCE It is not possible you have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he FLUTE No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens QUINCE Yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice FLUTE You must say 'paragon' a paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught Enter SNUG  SNUG Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men FLUTE O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have 'scaped sixpence a day an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged he would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing Enter BOTTOM  BOTTOM Where are these lads where are these hearts QUINCE Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour BOTTOM Masters, I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian I will tell you every thing, right as it fell out QUINCE Let us hear, sweet Bottom BOTTOM Not a word of me All that I will tell you is, that the duke hath dined Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is, our play is preferred In any case, let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy No more words away go, away Exeunt  ACT V  SCENE I Athens The palace of THESEUS  Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants HIPPOLYTA 'Tis strange my Theseus, that these lovers speak of THESEUS More strange than true I never may believe These antique fables, nor these fairy toys Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends The lunatic, the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman the lover, all as frantic, Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name Such tricks hath strong imagination, That if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together, More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy But, howsoever, strange and admirable THESEUS Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA  Joy, gentle friends joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts LYSANDER More than to us Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed THESEUS Come now what masques, what dances shall we have, To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bed-time Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call Philostrate PHILOSTRATE Here, mighty Theseus THESEUS Say, what abridgement have you for this evening What masque what music How shall we beguile The lazy time, if not with some delight PHILOSTRATE There is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your highness will see first Giving a paper  THESEUS Reads 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp' We'll none of that that have I told my love, In glory of my kinsman Hercules Reads  'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage' That is an old device and it was play'd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror Reads  'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning, late deceased in beggary' That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony Reads  'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisbe very tragical mirth' Merry and tragical tedious and brief That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow How shall we find the concord of this discord PHILOSTRATE A play there is, my lord, some ten words long, Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted And tragical, my noble lord, it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed THESEUS What are they that do play it PHILOSTRATE Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, Which never labour'd in their minds till now, And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories With this same play, against your nuptial THESEUS And we will hear it PHILOSTRATE No, my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain, To do you service THESEUS I will hear that play For never anything can be amiss, When simpleness and duty tender it Go, bring them in and take your places, ladies Exit PHILOSTRATE  HIPPOLYTA I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged And duty in his service perishing THESEUS Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind THESEUS The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit Where I have come, great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practised accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome Trust me, sweet, Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity In least speak most, to my capacity Re-enter PHILOSTRATE  PHILOSTRATE So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd THESEUS Let him approach Flourish of trumpets  Enter QUINCE for the Prologue  Prologue If we offend, it is with our good will That you should think, we come not to offend, But with good will To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end Consider then we come but in despite We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points LYSANDER He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral, my lord it is not enough to speak, but to speak true HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound, but not in government THESEUS His speech, was like a tangled chain nothing impaired, but all disordered Who is next Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion  Prologue Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on, till truth make all things plain This man is Pyramus, if you would know This beauteous lady Thisby is certain This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content To whisper At the which let no man wonder This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn, Presenteth Moonshine for, if you will know, By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name, The trusty Thisby, coming first by night, Did scare away, or rather did affright And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade, He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade, His dagger drew, and died For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain At large discourse, while here they do remain Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine  THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak DEMETRIUS No wonder, my lord one lion may, when many asses do Wall In this same interlude it doth befall That I, one Snout by name, present a wall And such a wall, as I would have you think, That had in it a crannied hole or chink, Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby, Did whisper often very secretly This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall the truth is so And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord Enter Pyramus  THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall silence Pyramus O grim-look'd night O night with hue so black O night, which ever art when day is not O night, O night alack, alack, alack, I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall, That stand'st between her father's ground and mine Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall, Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne Wall holds up his fingers  Thanks, courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this But what see I No Thisby do I see O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me THESEUS The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again Pyramus No, in truth, sir, he should not 'Deceiving me' is Thisby's cue she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you Yonder she comes Enter Thisbe  Thisbe O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones, Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee Pyramus I see a voice now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face Thisby Thisbe My love thou art, my love I think Pyramus Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace And, like Limander, am I trusty still Thisbe And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill Pyramus Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true Thisbe As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you Pyramus O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall Thisbe I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all Pyramus Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway Thisbe 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe  Wall Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so And, being done, thus Wall away doth go Exit  THESEUS Now is the mural down between the two neighbours DEMETRIUS No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard THESEUS The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination then, and not theirs THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion Enter Lion and Moonshine  Lion You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here, When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam For, if I should as lion come in strife Into this place, 'twere pity on my life THESEUS A very gentle beast, of a good conscience DEMETRIUS The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw LYSANDER This lion is a very fox for his valour THESEUS True and a goose for his discretion DEMETRIUS Not so, my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose THESEUS His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox It is well leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon Moonshine This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-- DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head THESEUS He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference Moonshine This lanthorn doth the horned moon present Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn How is it else the man i' the moon DEMETRIUS He dares not come there for the candle for, you see, it is already in snuff HIPPOLYTA I am aweary of this moon would he would change THESEUS It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time LYSANDER Proceed, Moon Moonshine All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I, the man in the moon this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush and this dog, my dog DEMETRIUS Why, all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon But, silence here comes Thisbe Enter Thisbe  Thisbe This is old Ninny's tomb Where is my love Lion Roaring Oh-- Thisbe runs off  DEMETRIUS Well roared, Lion THESEUS Well run, Thisbe HIPPOLYTA Well shone, Moon Truly, the moon shines with a good grace The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit  THESEUS Well moused, Lion LYSANDER And so the lion vanished DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus Enter Pyramus  Pyramus Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams, I trust to take of truest Thisby sight But stay, O spite But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here Eyes, do you see How can it be O dainty duck O dear Thy mantle good, What, stain'd with blood Approach, ye Furies fell O Fates, come, come, Cut thread and thrum Quail, crush, conclude, and quell THESEUS This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad HIPPOLYTA Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man Pyramus O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd with cheer Come, tears, confound Out, sword, and wound The pap of Pyramus Ay, that left pap, Where heart doth hop Stabs himself  Thus die I, thus, thus, thus Now am I dead, Now am I fled My soul is in the sky Tongue, lose thy light Moon take thy flight Exit Moonshine  Now die, die, die, die, die Dies  DEMETRIUS No die, but an ace, for him for he is but one LYSANDER Less than an ace, man for he is dead he is nothing THESEUS With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and prove an ass HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover THESEUS She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the play Re-enter Thisbe  HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief DEMETRIUS A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisbe, is the better he for a man, God warrant us she for a woman, God bless us LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes DEMETRIUS And thus she means, videlicet-- Thisbe Asleep, my love What, dead, my dove O Pyramus, arise Speak, speak Quite dumb Dead, dead A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes These My lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks, Are gone, are gone Lovers, make moan His eyes were green as leeks O Sisters Three, Come, come to me, With hands as pale as milk Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk Tongue, not a word Come, trusty sword Come, blade, my breast imbrue Stabs herself  And, farewell, friends Thus Thisby ends Adieu, adieu, adieu Dies  THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead DEMETRIUS Ay, and Wall too BOTTOM Starting up No assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company THESEUS No epilogue, I pray you for your play needs no excuse Never excuse for when the players are all dead, there needs none to be blamed Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is, truly and very notably discharged But come, your Bergomask let your epilogue alone A dance  The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve Lovers, to bed 'tis almost fairy time I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch'd This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night Sweet friends, to bed A fortnight hold we this solemnity, In nightly revels and new jollity Exeunt  Enter PUCK  PUCK Now the hungry lion roars, And the wolf behowls the moon Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, All with weary task fordone Now the wasted brands do glow, Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud Now it is the time of night That the graves all gaping wide, Every one lets forth his sprite, In the church-way paths to glide And we fairies, that do run By the triple Hecate's team, From the presence of the sun, Following darkness like a dream, Now are frolic not a mouse Shall disturb this hallow'd house I am sent with broom before, To sweep the dust behind the door Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train  OBERON Through the house give gathering light, By the dead and drowsy fire Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier And this ditty, after me, Sing, and dance it trippingly TITANIA First, rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note Hand in hand, with fairy grace, Will we sing, and bless this place Song and dance  OBERON Now, until the break of day, Through this house each fairy stray To the best bride-bed will we, Which by us shall blessed be And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be And the blots of Nature's hand Shall not in their issue stand Never mole, hare lip, nor scar, Nor mark prodigious, such as are Despised in nativity, Shall upon their children be With this field-dew consecrate, Every fairy take his gait And each several chamber bless, Through this palace, with sweet peace And the owner of it blest Ever shall in safety rest Trip away make no stay Meet me all by break of day Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train  PUCK If we shadows have offended, Think but this, and all is mended, That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream, Gentles, do not reprehend if you pardon, we will mend And, as I am an honest Puck, If we have unearned luck Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, We will make amends ere long Else the Puck a liar call So, good night unto you all Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends`;
